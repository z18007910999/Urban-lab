36,"To Stay or to Go? For Older New Yorkers, Either Option Is Fraught.",Claire Wolters and Katherine Marks,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/realestate/age-in-place-new-york-city-affordable-housing.html,2025-10-21,"Older New Yorkers face significant challenges aging in place or seeking new housing, particularly in rent-stabilized units. Many prewar apartments, while offering lower rents, have maintenance deficiencies, pests, and accessibility issues, impacting residents like Maureen Gangaram's mother. A majority of older adults are rent-burdened and on fixed incomes, struggling to afford market rates. Landlord intimidation and eviction threats also push seniors out. Demand for affordable, accessible senior housing far exceeds supply; for instance, Volunteers of America-Greater New York received 26,000 applications for 84 units. This crisis contributes to a growing homeless population among seniors, emphasizing the urgent need for support and suitable housing options.",6,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Maureen Gangaram is tired of putting money into her mother’s apartment. A tenant in a rent-stabilized unit in Brooklyn, Ms. Gangaram moved into the prewar building full time around 2020, after her mother’s dementia worsened. Her mother, who immigrated to New York from Guyana, has lived there since 1989. At one point, Ms. Gangaram’s father worked as the building’s super. While the unit contains memories of the Gangarams’ heritage, it has also become ridden with pests, vermin and clutter — nuisances that threaten Ms. Gangaram’s health and her mother’s ability to safely age in place. “No one should be in this condition,” Ms. Gangaram, 64, said. She waved a bug-bitten forearm at a bulge in her ceiling — a battle scar from the black, rusty water that leaked through it weeks ago — and shook her head. “They’re not fixing it,” she said, referring to management. For longtime tenants like Ms. Gangaram and her mother, New York City’s rent-stabilized apartments offer financially feasible housing options for aging in place. But while those units hold some of the city’s lowest rents, not all older adults can afford to stay put because of the risks their living environments pose to their health. And even those in safe conditions may find themselves relinquishing their tenure due to pressure from management companies. Older adults occupied more than half of the city’s rent-stabilized and rent-controlled units in 2021, according to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey . The survey found that 21 percent of rent-stabilized apartments had three or more maintenance deficiencies, compared with only 8 percent of unregulated apartments. Linna Zhu , a senior research associate in the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said that aging in place was both the most desired and least supported housing option for older adults. The challenges, she continued, were “particularly acute in places like New York City, where many older adults live in rent-stabilized or rent-controlled units.” Ms. Zhu added that rent-regulated units were commonly found in prewar buildings, which — maintenance issues aside — typically have narrow hallways, steep walk-ups and inaccessible bathrooms. Accessibility features can be limited or dilapidated, if they even exist at all. “Most apartments weren’t built for aging,” Ms. Zhu said. Yet, many adults remain in these homes. A majority of older adults in the city are rent-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent, according to a recent report by the New York City comptroller’s office . Many are also on fixed income, meaning the gap between their monthly wages and monthly rent expenditures may exceed 30 percent. Three-quarters of New York City older adults received Social Security income in 2023, amounting to a total annual payment of under $16,500. Their monthly earnings, which amount to about $1,375, are lower than the state’s fair market rent for a one-bedroom apartment, which is $2,125 . But price isn’t the sole motivator to stay in place, either. For the Gangarams, who pay less than $1,000 in rent, their apartment connects them to their community. “Where would we go?” Ms. Gangaram said. “This is the only place we know. We came up from Guyana, we settled here. My mom worked until she was 80 years old. So, why would we want to leave?” Many older adults who leave rent-stabilized apartments don’t do so by choice, but in response to building sales, major renovation improvements or eviction. Like the rusty water in Ms. Gangaram’s unit, fear of eviction drips from the ceilings of some prewar buildings, causing tenants to turn corners or lower voices when their super enters the hall. Marcus Jackson , the manager of advocacy, community and government relations at Encore Community Services, an organization that provides housing, meals and social support to aging New Yorkers, said it was not uncommon for landlords to use intimidation tactics to weed out older adults. Lauren Carden, the director of California housing advocacy at Justice In Aging, a national organization, urges people not to automatically leave their apartments in response to an eviction notice. “Just because someone gives you a notice doesn’t mean that they fully complied with the law, and that is required before they can remove you from the unit,” she said. Mr. Jackson said he has helped older adults navigate housing challenges, such as makeshift letters forged with counterfeit stamps, illegal rent increases or cessation of maintenance. He has seen tenants go years without paint jobs, or dwell among pests, leaky faucets or malfunctioning radiators. The top barrier adults face to aging in place is “literally just keeping their place,” Mr. Jackson said. It’s “100 times harder to move someone back into a residence after they’ve already left, no matter what the circumstance may be.” So even when their electrical cords are dangling from the circuits, he continued, it can be in a tenant’s best interest to hang on. Older renters with extremely low incomes — under 30 percent of the area’s median family income — may not be able to avoid rent burden. Across the country, senior adults make up a third of renters with extremely low incomes, according to a study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition . And among seniors registered on New York City Housing Connect, a program designed to help people find affordable housing, 57 percent of them had extremely low incomes, according to a 2024 report by LiveOn NY , an advocacy group. Older renters who lack additional support may not be pushed into the new housing market so much as out of it. Nationally, older adults are the fastest growing population of homeless people , and in New York City the number of homeless adults over 65 has almost tripled over the last decade. The trends are worrisome for today’s older adults and future generations, Ms. Carden said. “The population in general of older adults is growing, so we can see down the road that this problem is going to get worse unless we take action,” she said. Bridgett Simmons, a staff lawyer at the National Housing Law Project, advises older adults to keep documentation about their apartment, which can include digital records like emails, physical communications like letters or signed leases or audio recordings of meetings or calls — if recorded legally. Such records can help protect people from unjust evictions, particularly if they are fighting their landlord in court. People may find additional support through initiatives like the city’s adult protective services, housing vouchers or the senior rent freeze program. Some older adults have successfully aged in place with help from city, state, federal and nonprofit services. Natalia Shapiro, who has lived in New York City since 1995, moved into an affordable housing unit with the nonprofit SelfHelp in 2012. Ms. Shapiro, who previously lived in a fourth-floor walk-up in Queens, said her current home was incomparable to her last. “I’m very old and need many changes in this age,” Ms. Shapiro, 87, said. “It is not easy to walk.” Now, she has the physical assistance of an elevator and the emotional support of a social worker, as well as benefits from Section 8, food stamps and medical insurance. Hannah Adjei, who moved to New York from Ghana in 2018, lived in various apartments with roommates before becoming a resident in Volunteers of America-Greater New York’s newest supportive senior housing in the Bronx this June. The building’s accessibility features, like railings and a shower chair, have helped her stay in the city, said Ms. Adjei, 64. “And no cockroaches.” Demand for these units, however, far exceeds supply. In 2021, when Volunteers of America-Greater New York opened its home in the Bronx, the group received about 26,000 applications for 84 units, said Eric Lee, the organization’s director of public policy. At Encore, the wait list for one of the organization’s buildings averages around 10 years. “It’s heartbreaking,” Mr. Lee said. “But it speaks volumes to just how desperate aging New Yorkers are to be able to find an affordable place.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/02/multimedia/21re-nyc-stayinplace-ext-ptqh/21re-nyc-stayinplace-ext-ptqh-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
37,A Designer’s Bathroom Dipped in Yves Klein Blue,Sydney Gore and Philip Cheung,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/realestate/a-bathroom-dipped-in-yves-klein-blue.html,2025-10-21,"Jamie Lenore McKillop renovated the bathroom of her 3,000-square-foot Venice Beach home, acquired in late 2019, as it felt out of place. The three-month renovation incorporated International Klein Blue (IKB), a pigment created by artist Yves Klein. New G22 Opal Blue tiles from Heath Ceramics, inspired by IKB, replaced original ones, and the existing vanity was preserved and upgraded with Dornbracht fixtures. IKB is also central to Ms. McKillop's 2023 home décor brand, Lazy Jamie, which sells stainless steel items, including a portable TV tray table in her signature blue. She considers the bathroom her personal retreat.",10,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"When Jamie Lenore McKillop and her husband moved to Venice Beach at the end of 2019, the couple felt as if they had secured their Los Angeles dream home. The 3,000-square-foot property straddles the line between midcentury-modern and modernist, a rarity at a time when the area’s newly developed houses look more or less the same. Ms. McKillop was adamant about keeping the original features, but the bathroom felt noticeably out of place compared with the rest of the house. Every other room had its own personality: the kitchen pistachio green with a cherry red hidden bar cabinet; a bedroom in butter yellow; and the exposed stairs in the ceiling above the kitchen sink where her cat perches and plays peek-a-boo. “I wanted to find a way to keep the integrity and the character, but do something that felt more current, but also a bit more of a statement,” she said. During the three-month renovation, Ms. McKillop became obsessed with International Klein Blue , the dynamic pigment created by the French artist Yves Klein in 1961. In addition to being the new backdrop for her bathroom tiles, this specific shade has become an integral part of the identity for Lazy Jamie , a home décor brand Ms. McKillop founded in 2023. She sells a variety of stainless steel home wares, the latest being a portable TV tray table with a mirror chrome tubular steel base and high-gloss wood top in her signature color. “Yves Klein said that blue was limitless,” Ms. McKillop said. “I want to challenge how people experience rest through furniture, so the definition of blue acting as a kind of freedom and as an antidote to restrictive limits really resonates with me. I hope to subvert the idea of laziness to be positive.” So while Gen Z is busy bed rotting , Ms. McKillop, 33, prefers losing track of time in the bathroom. “The bathroom is my favorite because I can lock the door and don’t have to worry about anyone coming in,” she said. “It’s not just a bathroom; it’s a dressing room, a makeshift spa, and sometimes an office. It’s my retreat.” Ms. McKillop shared a few essential pieces that have elevated her bathroom experience. A TV tray, Ms. McKillop said, can be an “unexpected furniture piece for your most in-between moment,” whether that takes place in the living room, bedroom or bathroom. “It’s this moment of joy that none of us really talk about, but we all share,” she said. “It feels so good, when my partner’s out of town, or when I’m alone, and that’s what I’m doing — I’m not eating in silence at a dining table.” Inspired by her grandmother and the trays around her house, Ms. McKillop reimagined a version with this generation in mind. Unsurprisingly, she wanted to “bring in the blue in a really prominent way,” so the removable butler tray is powder-coated in International Klein Blue or off-white for fans of neutral palettes . She emphasized that the table was designed for solo activities in smaller spaces rather than as part of a set for an entire household. The designer uses it in a variety of ways, including as a desk while working from her bed, a platform for watching movies in the bathtub, or “an ultra chic tampon holder” next to the toilet, she said. “When I was in my 20s and had roommates we would eat in front of the TV, we wouldn’t sit at the dining table,” she said. “More of us than ever are living in small spaces and eating in front of the TV because oftentimes we’re ordering takeout and watching Netflix. Our culture is much more set up for that moment than they are the Norman Rockwell idea of eating dinner.” While many of the fixtures desperately needed to be replaced, Ms. McKillop insisted that the driving force behind the bathroom renovation was color not cosmetics. Since the original tiles, which were a “very ’90s blue,” needed to be ripped out regardless, Ms. McKillop thought it would be fun to update them with a hue that felt more current. While searching for International Klein Blue ceramic subway tiles online, she was led to the G22 Opal Blue Tile from Heath Ceramics, which has stores in California and Texas. “Now that I feel like I’ve become more entrenched in this Yves Klein Blue world, I’ve researched more about the blue, why people are drawn to it and his beliefs around it,” she said. “It’s hard to define, but it’s sort of this ultramarine. He has said that it has no dimensions, it’s kind of limitless and it represents freedom — that’s why when you look at it, it has that calming, relaxing quality.” Ms. McKillop is so fond of the tiles that she has a matching ceramic mug and bowl for a pleasing “pop of blue” on her table, too. A good vanity is hard to find these days, so Ms. McKillop was willing to do whatever was necessary in order to preserve the original piece in her bathroom. She sanded down and polished the stone countertop, and then upgraded the outdated fixtures with ones from Dornbracht . Her followers on TikTok and Instagram continue to leave comments saying how beautiful the contrast is between the orange-tinted rosewood and deep blue tiles. “When you have the sunlight coming in, it definitely creates more of that contrast and it really pops,” she said. “Unfortunately, because it’s vintage at this point, it is one of a kind. You can’t buy it, but someone should make it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/30/multimedia/30re-designfinds-mckillop-02-mtkc/30re-designfinds-mckillop-02-mtkc-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
38,He Left the City for a Cat in Brooklyn,D.W. Gibson,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/realestate/new-york-rental-gowanus.html,2025-10-20,"Dimitrios Petsas, 55, a Vice President at Estée Lauder, moved from downtown Manhattan to Gowanus, Brooklyn, in March, because of his cat, Lucy. Petsas, a longtime downtown resident, adopted Lucy, a malnourished kitten, in Athens in 2023. After falling in love with Lucy, he needed an apartment with a separate room to get sleep, as his open-plan downtown home did not suit them. Unable to find a suitable downtown unit, and noting downtown Manhattan's post-pandemic changes, he found a $5350 rental in Gowanus. He liked the design of the unit at 655 Union and the neighborhood's ""grit"" reminiscent of 90s TriBeCa. Petsas and Lucy are now settled.",7,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Dimitrios Petsas’s love for downtown Manhattan ran so deep he couldn’t bring himself to leave. “I never lived above Bleecker,” he said. “I took great pride in it — and I can actually recite all of my apartments.” There was Murray Street and William Street, two different apartments on 80 John Street and the place in Tribeca Tower. “That was when 9/11 happened,” said Mr. Petsas, 55. “I lived on the 49th floor, so I saw everything.” It was the mid-90s version of TriBeCa that he really loved. “It was no man’s land. No tourists. I would go rollerblading at night, it was amazing.” Over the years, Mr. Petsas periodically left New York, always instigated by work, for short stints in other cities — Los Angeles, Houston, Singapore, Tokyo, London. “I’ve been in New York on and off all my life, mostly on. And friends make fun of me because they say I’m a creature of habit, which I am. I find a restaurant and never switch. But I don’t have a problem just picking up and moving countries.” With each return to New York, he renewed his allegiance to the same quaint radius of downtown Manhattan. That is, until Lucy came into his life. $5350 | Gowanus Occupation: Vice President of Global Brand Voice at Estée Lauder On professional fidelity: Mr. Petsas’s long career in advertising not only spans across cities but also several agencies. “I started out at Ogilvy but I worked at a number of places — McCann, Grey, Leo Burnett, Deutsch, Saatchi & Saatchi,” he said. “I like to joke that there were no other agencies to sleep with, so I moved on to the brand side.” He joined Estée Lauder in 2022. On long-distance relationships: Mr. Petsas’s husband, Hiro Takata, works as a United Nations diplomat and moves from post to post, all around the world, with little time in New York. Next stop: Abidjan, Ivory Coast. But the couple make a point to see each other every four to six weeks with daily video calls sustaining them between reunions. “There are definitely moments of loneliness,” Mr. Petsas said. “But it’s a lifestyle that suits us. We’re both very self-sufficient and independent.” He met Lucy on a trip to his hometown, Athens, in 2023. “I was walking with my sister,” he said, “and we saw something and thought it was a rag on the ground. We realized it was a kitten. We almost stepped on her.” Mr. Petsas picked up the malnourished animal and took her to a veterinarian. “Immediately the vet said, ‘I don’t know if she’s going to make it.’ She was almost dead.” Initially Mr. Petsas’s sister brought Lucy to live with her. She was the one who named the feline in honor of Lucille Ball. “It was because she was funny and expressive,” Mr. Petsas said. “And somewhat of a klutz for a cat.” But his sister soon discovered that her partner was allergic to cats. So, Mr. Petsas stepped in. “I said, ‘All right, I’ll find her another home.’” A few days later, Mr. Petsas was flying back to New York with Lucy. “That was not the easiest part of my life,” he said. “She was not a good traveler. She might have been blacklisted on United Airlines. She crawled out of her carrier, passengers on other planes could hear her. She was so loud, it was comical. But we made it.” Mr. Petsas’s plan to find another home for the feline was soon abandoned. “Of course, I fell in love with her,” he said, “so she ended up staying.” There was just one problem. “It was a very quirky living situation because my apartment was a big open space, and she kept waking me up in the morning. I just couldn’t do it anymore.” He knew he needed to find a new place — somewhere with a door that he could close at night — and he started looking for a suitable one-bedroom in his building. Nothing came up. He branched out to other buildings in the neighborhood but wasn’t having luck. Everything was either too small or too expensive. He looked for a couple of weeks. Early mornings brought the zoomies for Lucy and sleeplessness for Mr. Petsas. Then one day an ad caught his eye: rentals in a building in the Gowanus neighborhood of Brooklyn. “I said to myself, ‘Well, why not?’” It was a big decision but the passage of time had made it an easy decision. “I think one of the reasons was because after the pandemic, the neighborhood had changed so much,” Mr. Petsas said of downtown Manhattan. “It had become more crowded and a lot more impersonal. It had lost a lot of its texture and color and I was missing that.” So he made an appointment to look at a unit he’d seen in the ad. “I liked the neighborhood but I was not that crazy about the building.” On his way home, 655 Union had caught his eye. “I’m very lazy, so I liked the fact that it was right next to the R train station,” he said. He came back the next day to look at a couple of units. “I liked how much thought had gone behind the design,” he said. “There was a finesse to it. Also, I am very spoiled, having lived in Japan and Singapore, where everything is just insanely pristine. I was kind of chasing that and it usually does not exist in New York, no matter how much you pay.” Gowanus also made him feel right at home; it reminded him of what TriBeCa was like in the 1990s. “It has a little bit of grit, a little bit of color. Right across the street from me there are auto body shops and there’s graffiti. I do enjoy that.” Mr. Petsas and Lucy moved into the building in March. The beginning was challenging. “She was a little unhappy with the closed door the first couple of nights,” he said. “There was a little bit of meowing, a little bit of scratching on the door, but then she was fine.” Now they’re both comfortable. “I’m happier just having my own room and having my nine hours of sleep every night,” he said. “And she’s just very happy to see me in the morning.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/20/multimedia/20re-renters-petsas-gkcp/20re-renters-petsas-gkcp-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
39,"For the Ghosts in a Berkshires Mansion, the Gilded Age Never Ended",Alexandra Marvar and Lauren Lancaster,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/realestate/ventfort-hall-gilded-age-berkshires.html,2025-10-20,"Ventfort Hall, a 28,000-square-foot Gilded Age mansion built in 1893 for J.P. Morgan's sister, Sarah, in Lenox, Massachusetts, is undergoing extensive restoration. Rescued from demolition in the 1990s by the Ventfort Hall Association, the foundation has invested over $6 million in repairs since its public opening in 2000. Led by Executive Director Wendy Healey and Director of Programming Chelsea Gaia, restoration is approximately halfway complete, targeting the house's 150th anniversary in 2043. Ventfort Hall embraces perceived paranormal activity with ghost tours and programming, implementing ""Paranormal Policies."" The association recently reacquired its gardener's cottage, aiming to integrate original outbuildings for new revenue streams.",9,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"Will the salon piano fall through the beetle-eaten, 19th-century parquet floors? Is there any way to get the great hall’s 185-pound mahogany pocket door to stay on its track? How many more rainstorms can the patched roof withstand? In Lenox, Mass., a small town in the Berkshires, a bootstrapped foundation has spent nearly three decades tackling these questions while rebuilding, repairing and protecting a 28,000-square-foot Gilded Age mansion called Ventfort Hall. The pinnacle of grandeur when it was built in 1893, this 17-fireplace, 22-bedroom, Jacobean Revival “summer cottage” first belonged to J.P. Morgan’s sister, Sarah. Its present-day stewards have a lot on their minds. They are front desk attendants one moment, apprentices to a septuagenarian master craftsman the next. They’ve always been underfunded, and there is always more to do. But in the past three years, a new energy is swirling, propelling things forward. Or is it an old energy — old as the mansion’s original owner herself? The museum’s matriarchs, teenage tarot students, pro bono paranormal investigators, and history buffs say it’s the ghost of Sarah Morgan, taking part in the restoration of her manorial magnum opus. She isn’t alone. When the prominent American banker Junius Spencer Morgan had a fatal fall from a horse-drawn carriage in 1890 , he left a fortune to his children. The financier John Pierpont— J.P. — inherited $15 million , fueling his already powerful banking empire. His sister Sarah inherited $3 million, putting more than a third of it into this real estate passion project with her husband (and distant cousin), George Hale Morgan. With its gabled carriage house, gatehouse, gardener’s cottage, six greenhouses, and Italianate walled gardens, all designed by the architectural firm Rotch & Tilden, Ventfort Hall was “on a scale never before seen in Lenox,” said the historian Cornelia Gilder, author of “Houses of the Berkshires, 1870 — 1930 .” This stretch of Berkshire County, Mass., drew prominent Americans, including the Vanderbilts, the Carnegies and Edith Wharton, whose 1902 home, the Mount, is two miles down the road. For three summers, Sarah opened Ventfort Hall with fanfare , throwing lavish parties well into the days of fall foliage. The summer of 1895 was her last. She died in 1896, at 57. George lived on at Ventfort until 1911, and in the years that followed, the house had many lives: ballet school; dormitory for the nearby music venue, Tanglewood; artists’ enclave and resort; hideaway for a fundamentalist Christian sect. But perhaps the most transformative period was the 13 years it sat abandoned. In the 1990s, a nursing home developer purchased Ventfort and began moving forward with plans to demolish it, but the community stepped in, fund-raised the $40,000 down payment needed to buy the building, and rescued it. “The house was alive,” said Tjasa Sprague, 85, a Lenox resident who co-founded the Ventfort Hall Association in 1997. She meant it figuratively — the architecture invited imagination with all its nooks and niches — but also literally. Trees sprouted from the gutters. Bats flew out of the fireplaces; squirrels and raccoons made strange noises that echoed through the heating ducts. When it first set about restoring Ventfort, the association had its work cut out for it. The first winter, the ice on the great hall floor was thick enough for skating. The dining room floor was missing altogether. Maybe most harrowing, however, were the code compliance and fire safety issues. Still, they thought the house was grand. “We were sufficiently naïve to have absolutely no idea what a nightmare we had walked into with the building inspector,” Ms. Sprague said. She and her friends rolled up their sleeves and got to work. Among the first line items: thousands of dollars in tarps for 7,000 square feet of roof, “just to stop the water from pouring in,” she said. Architects and engineers shored up the structure. Artisan craftsmen recreated the interiors. As Ms. Sprague and her colleagues took the house apart in order to put it back together, strange things would happen: inexplicable “clouds” appearing in her photographs, the illusion of lit candles in the dining room on the day it was finally finished. These oddities could be explained away — but she didn’t always bother. “I decided that was a ghost,” she said. “It was Sarah, or whoever.” Ms. Sprague said she thought the ghosts were watching. “We always thought Sarah approved of what we did,” she added. Three years and more than $1.5 million later, Ventfort Hall opened to the public in 2000, Ms. Sprague said. Progress continued, slow and steady. The most dire issues abated. But the slamming doors, sounds of voices and footsteps, and the sense that the Morgans were along for the ride, did not. The association’s financial records show that it has put more than $6 million into the restoration, primarily from donors and grants. The main spaces downstairs are immaculate, but the house is far from finished. Ventfort’s core crew is one of historic preservation enthusiasts, D.I.Y.-ers, and local creatives, many of whom said that from their very first visit, they felt connected to the home. Wendy Healey became the mansion’s executive director in December 2022. A creative at heart with a background in finance, she was drawn to the association’s drive to make the house a welcoming and useful place. To Ms. Healey, this means broader-reaching programming. “The Gilded Age has so much romance and drama and glitter and beauty,” she said. “But there was another side to that, and the Gilded Age was only a very short time period in the history of this house.” Last year, Ventfort hired Chelsea Gaia, 40, as director of programming and events. One of her first projects: a “rebrand” that included a reimagining of the newsletter as a Victorian-era gossip column. Many historic museums take a polished, professional tone — but that does not feel like Ventfort, she said. “The chairs are wobbly. The china is chipped — and we use it! There’s not much behind velvet ropes here.” Ventfort’s other big differentiator is the matter of the ghosts. The house has featured in its share of hokey “ghost hunter” shows. Ms. Gaia is, in addition to a marketing maven, a spiritual medium, and the energy at Ventfort is what drew her to the role. To her (and many other people involved) there is no question that past residents, including the Morgans, are present — and able to contribute. David Raby, a paranormal investigator in Connecticut who has hosted “encounters” at Ventfort for eight years, agrees. “There’s just that stigma that every spirit you communicate with is trapped somehow,” he said, adding, “Not everyone needs help.” “I don’t think many of the spirits at Ventfort Hall are trapped — they just come and go as they please,” Mr. Raby said. Ms. Gaia also incorporated tarot and astrology into Ventfort’s programming. “Funny enough, the Gilded Age is when a lot of that took off,” she said of spiritualism. J.P. Morgan himself was said to have been a patron of the astrologer Evangeline Adams, who claimed she furnished the banker with regular readings on the planets’ effects on the stock market. These activities — including ghost-related events — generate only a small percent of Ventfort’s annual budget. But they have longer-tail benefits. It was this “not your typical Gilded Age” community that brought Christiana Wagner and her 13-year-old daughter, Eleadora, to the property. Not long after they moved to Berkshire County from California, they attended a Ventfort ghost tour, an event full of spooky history and hearsay that is offered all year. Eleadora was initially nervous about wandering the halls of a creepy house in the dark. But she was pleasantly surprised. “I remember honestly being very scared to go in because I didn’t want to see any ghosts,” she said. “Now that I’ve felt the energy more, I’m like, they’re very chill.” For her upcoming eighth-grade service project, she plans to spend her 40 volunteer hours assisting with Ventfort’s archives — the house’s newest recruit. In Ventfort’s halls, including at its biweekly tarot club, she feels a sense of warmth and welcome. “It’s almost like Ventfort is my home, even though I don’t live there,” she said. Ventfort’s decision to embrace its spooky self goes beyond a rebrand. Ms. Gaia has also written a set of Paranormal Policies, which include a ban on Ouija boards, séances, summoning and “spells of any kind.” Outsider paranormal investigations are no longer permitted. That’s a lost revenue opportunity, Ms. Gaia acknowledged. “But we all agreed that it was most respectful to the spirits here to only work with people we know, who respect them as well. It’s not worth having bogus narratives and sensationalized, unsubstantiated lore attached to spirits” who can’t speak for themselves, she said. Ms. Healey estimates Ventfort Hall’s restoration is “about halfway done.” A wing built for Sarah and George’s daughter, Caroline Morgan, the original basement kitchen and the entire third floor have yet to be tackled. There’s also a deadline: 2043, the house’s 150th anniversary. While there’s plenty left to do, the scope keeps expanding. This summer, the team leaped at an opportunity it could barely afford: buying back the Ventfort Hall gardener’s cottage.

44,The Odd History of the Rowhouse at the Center of the N.B.A. Betting Scandal,Rachel Wharton,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/realestate/nba-gambling-scandal-house.html,2025-10-26,"A 186-year-old Greenwich Village townhouse at 80 Washington Place became prominent after an NBA betting scandal was revealed. Prosecutors allege the house was used for illegal poker games controlled by the Gambino crime family. Thomas “Juice” Gelardo, an alleged associate of the Bonanno and Genovese crime families, was arrested along with over 30 others indicted on Oct. 23 for gambling and rigged poker games, with the house listed in the indictment. The property has a diverse history, serving as a single-family home, boardinghouse, and event space, with past connections to figures like John Philip Sousa and Kylie Jenner. It sold for $17 million in 2024 after 12 years on the market.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"After a betting scandal touching the worlds of professional sports and organized crime was revealed this week, a 186-year-old Greenwich Village townhouse suddenly shot up in the rankings of vintage New York City homes with great stories to tell. “This house has a good one,” Tom Miller, an author who has chronicled the histories of thousands of Manhattan buildings, said of the townhouse, at 80 Washington Place. “There’s Kylie Jenner and Sousa. And now we have a Mafia guy?” That guy is Thomas “Juice” Gelardo, an alleged associate of the Bonanno and Genovese crime families, who was arrested Thursday along with more than 30 other people. Prosecutors allege that the house was being used to stage illegal poker games controlled by the Gambino crime family. In 2023, according to indictments unsealed in federal court, Mr. Gelardo barged into the house with a group of armed men and assaulted the operator of a competing poker game. And that is just one link in a chain of boldface names and notable incidents recorded at this address, which has been at various points a single-family home, a boardinghouse, subdivided apartments, vacant and derelict, and, most recently, a renovated townhome and event space with a mix of old stone and sunlight priced at more than $30 million. It is a “super-rare” spot, said Nicole Palermo of the real estate firm Serhant , which helped the previous owner sell the house in 2024 after more than a dozen years on the market. “We always said, ‘It’s a penthouse with the privacy of a townhouse,’” she said. The house may look like just another of the brick-faced rowhouses that dot the streets of Greenwich Village, but the walls are teeming with stories. William Berwick builds a pair of townhomes at 80 Washington Place and 78 Washington Place, in the Greek Revival style that has come to define Greenwich Village. Mr. Berwick, who owned both houses until 1852, was likely one of many “speculators” who built homes to sell to residents of Lower Manhattan who were migrating north, Mr. Miller said. Now a high-end boardinghouse, according to Mr. Miller’s research, 80 Washington Place is home to Columbia College students, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Willa Cather and a numerologist named Clifford W. Cheasley. The composer and military band leader John Philip Sousa acquires the building. “He never lived there,” Mr. Miller said. “I think he bought it as an apartment for his daughter and gave it to her as a gift, because he only charged them $100.” Sousa’s daughter, Helen Sousa Abert, and her husband hire an architect to renovate the building into an apartment complex. They add an elevator and a fourth story, and they remove the stoop, lowering the original entrance so that visitors now enter through the basement level — essentially the same facade you see today. According to Mr. Miller’s research, a reverend named John Wade, a tenant at 80 Washington Place, attracts coverage in The Evening World newspaper for his encounter with a bird that flew into his window, fooling him into thinking a robbery was taking place. (Not yet.) The Greenwich Village Historic District, which includes 80 Washington Place and Washington Square Park to the east, is designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission under Mayor John V. Lindsay. Now owned by a corporation known as John Philip Sousa, Inc., the building is sold to the Cin-Cin Realty Corporation, according to city records. Gildo and Marie Rainero buy 80 Washington Place, according to city records. The family would own the building for the next 52 years. Previously, the couple lived nearby at 4 Washington Square Village, which is now New York University graduate housing. A neighborhood report in The New York Times tracks the sale of marijuana in nearby Washington Square Park. “In recent decades,” it states, “Villagers and tourists seeking the park’s repose have been just as likely to be greeted with a steady chorus of ‘smoke, smoke’ and ‘sense, sense,’ from drug dealers hawking marijuana and sensimilla, a potent strain of the drug.” Photos captured by Google Street View show a renovation in progress, with the windows of the building boarded up and the front stoop walled off. A gut renovation by the Clodagh design firm of Manhattan is underway. “It was an awful mess,” said Clodagh, the firm’s mononymous founder, who gutted the interior before redesigning the “very, very special” space as a six-bedroom, 8,700-square-foot home. Among the features: a 700-bottle wine room, a glassed-in sauna, 11 skylights and a waterfall in an old coal scuttle. “It’s one of the most exciting things I’ve ever done,” Clodagh said. A New York Daily News article profiles the listing of 80 Washington Place by the firm Douglas Elliman. The home is owned by William Rainero, who says that he grew up in one of nine apartments in the building, and that his family has been in the neighborhood “since before Ellis Island.” “The listing price is $31.5 million, and that’s where I’ll sell it,” Mr. Rainero tells the newspaper. “There is no reason to sell this for anything less than I’m asking. I would consider renting it for around $115,000, maybe.” Jonathan Miller, an appraiser with Miller Samuel, notes on his blog that the price of the building has been reduced by a million dollars, and that a new brokerage is now responsible for the sale. “After watching their townhouse sit on the market for a year without a sale, the owners of 80 Washington Place have decided to take a cue from its previous owner, composer and conductor John Philip Sousa: they’re marching on,” he writes. An Instagram account is created for the house, outlining a new purpose: “Ultra-Luxury Townhouse in Greenwich Village developed by William Rainero — Available for exclusive events & shoots.” The New York Post reports that 80 Washington Place — still owned by Mr. Rainero, but “not currently on the market” — will be rented by the rapper Travis Scott and his girlfriend, the reality television star Kylie Jenner. The house later appears in an episode of “The Kardashians.” Bankruptcy: The 80 West Washington Place Real Estate Holdings, LLC files for Chapter 11 protection a day before a scheduled foreclosure sale, according to Bloomberg News, which calls the home a “posh townhouse.” In October, Mr. Gelardo, armed with a baton, breaks into the house to disrupt an illegal poker game being run on the same night as a competing game, according to prosecutors. After a dozen years on the market, Mr. Rainero finally sells 80 Washington Place for $17 million in cash to an anonymous buyer under the guise of an LLC. The selling price is about half of what he wanted for the building in 2012. In June, Marmol Radziner, a Los Angeles-based architectural firm, files plans with the Landmarks Preservation Commission to amend the roof and the fence line of the building. The client is not named. On Oct. 23, the F.B.I. and the New York Police Department’s Joint Organized Crime Task Force indict more than 30 people on charges of gambling on N.B.A. basketball games and running poker games rigged by Mafia families, listing 80 Washington Place in the indictment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/24/multimedia/24re-SCANDAL-HOUSE-cfpg/24re-SCANDAL-HOUSE-cfpg-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
45,"Ballrooms May Be a Gilded Relic, but They Still Have Their Devotees",Ronda Kaysen and Dan Levin,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/27/realestate/ballrooms-white-house.html,2025-10-27,"President Trump's White House will feature its first grand ballroom since 1800, a 90,000-square-foot addition. Ballrooms, once Gilded Age mainstays, have declined in popularity, with only 47 Zillow listings nationwide as of October 24. However, some affluent individuals remain devoted, such as RuPaul, who has a large, decorated ballroom in his Beverly Hills home. Interior designers like Thomas Jayne prefer ballrooms to 'great rooms.' Historically, ballrooms were central to late 19th-century American high society. Modern iterations, like Stephen and Mary Marsh's flexible 'sports court/ballroom hybrid,' adapt to varied uses. Yet, a colossal ballroom can hinder property sales, as seen with Steve and Maxine Phillips' Annapolis estate.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"President Trump’s 90,000-square-foot White House ballroom, set to rise from the rubble of what was, until last week, the building’s East Wing, will be the first grand banquet hall at the People’s House since it opened in 1800. Once a mainstay of the Gilded Age, when high society gathered in the great mansions of Manhattan and Newport, R.I., the ballroom has fallen out of favor as a coveted amenity of the very rich. And yet, for a festive few, a palatial home is not complete without a room that pairs best with champagne flutes and a 12-piece band. “It’s a great luxury to offer a place where people can come together, and the ballroom is that type of gesture,” said Thomas Jayne, an interior designer who, despite his appreciation for the feature, does not have a ballroom of his own. But RuPaul does. In the Beverly Hills home that the queen of drag shares with his husband, RuPaul created a gargantuan ballroom with a 24-foot ceiling, black-and-white floors and a Hollywood Regency-style fireplace. The furniture is on wheels so it can be rolled out for dancing in the space, which he refers to as his disco room. Fittingly, it has 26 disco balls (the largest is five feet in diameter) that rotate and light up. “It becomes the most glittering room, I think, probably in the whole of Beverly Hills,” said Martyn Lawrence Bullard, RuPaul’s interior designer. The décor is a nod to RuPaul’s heroes — walls are adorned with photos of luminaries like Billie Holiday, Grace Jones, Tina Turner and Josephine Baker — and also to the classic ballroom aesthetic. “The room is surrounded by those extraordinary images in the very same way the original ballrooms in the 18th and 19th centuries were filled with portraiture,” Mr. Bullard said. Grand ballrooms, a staple of European aristocracy for centuries, entered the American consciousness in the late 19th century, with the rise of an elite class of people eager to establish their place atop a budding social hierarchy. In Newport, gilded ballrooms inside even more gilded summer seaside “cottages” became the backdrop for high-society soirees, whether for a young socialite’s debut or a summer-season ball at Rosecliff, the Newport mansion with the largest ballroom in town. (It was later used as a set for the 1974 film adaptation of “The Great Gatsby.”) “A gala room is never meant to be seen except when crowded: The crowd takes the place of furniture,” Edith Wharton explained in her 1897 book, “The Decoration of Houses,” which she wrote with the architect Ogden Codman Jr. “Occupied by a small number of people, such a room looks out of proportion, stiff and empty.” In 1910, the coal baron Edward J. Berwind and his wife inaugurated the social season with a dance in their new ballroom, decorated in the style of Louis XV with richly carved woodwork painted cream and white. In 1924, the chairman of Lea & Perrins, which produced the original Worcestershire sauce, erected a 3,200-square-foot temporary ballroom for 600 guests and two orchestras on the lawn of his Newport estate. “All exposed portions of the ballroom building had been painted a deep blue inside and out,” The New York Times reported at the time, “while inside the walls had been hung with huge Tudor tapestries, 20 feet high, the soft colorings of these with their figures of ships and the like against the blue background and lighted with hidden amber flood lights and large blue bells trimmed with yellow gave a very pleasing effect.” After the Great Depression and World War II, Americans lost their appetite for ballroom dancing, dinner jackets and hosting on a supersized scale. Later came the open-concept floor plan, with the great room, and eventually the all-purpose party barn. As of Oct. 24, there were a scant 47 Zillow listings with ballrooms nationwide. Ken Fulk, an interior designer, described these modern rooms as “able to adapt to a life well lived, and if that means curling up on a sofa with a dog or hosting 40 or 100 of your friends for a big celebration, great.” The Prohibition-era estate that Stephen and Mary Marsh bought in Portland, Ore., in 2017, came with a 2,100-square-foot indoor “sports court/ballroom hybrid” added by the previous owner, Mr. Marsh said. Accessible through a breezeway and down a staircase in the 25,568-square-foot house, the space could accommodate his daughter’s volleyball practice or 150 guests for birthday and graduation parties. Each feature was designed for flexibility, including a retractable lighting system. “You could play basketball in there and not worry about hitting them,” Mr. Marsh said. For some, the modern style feels muddled. “Why have a great room when you can have a ballroom?” Mr. Jayne said. “I’d rather have a ballroom.” So did Steve Phillips, a seafood magnate, who, with his wife Maxine, transformed an abandoned friary on 23 acres in Annapolis, Md., into a 35,435-square-foot estate . They reconfigured the chapel into an 1,800-square-foot ballroom with a limestone fireplace and arched doors that open onto a deck overlooking the Severn River. The couple have been trying to sell the home since 2020. It’s currently listed for $19.995 million, and the colossal ballroom doesn’t exactly help. “People come to the house and they love it,” said Brad Kappel, the listing agent. “But they just can’t wrap their head around how would they use it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/09/multimedia/25re-ballrooms-fbwc/25re-ballrooms-fbwc-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp

Citizenship is not required for a mortgage, but new HUD rules from March eliminated FHA loan eligibility for nonpermanent residents, prioritizing U.S. citizens. This shift may lead to questions raising anti-discrimination concerns, especially if based on stereotypes. However, verifying identity is standard. Experts suggest transparency from underwriters to avoid the appearance of discrimination.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Q: I’m a real estate broker in Hudson, N.Y. I have two buyers, men who married in New York State and are also foreign-born U.S. citizens. The mortgage underwriter asked for one of my buyers’ proof of citizenship in the form of his “naturalization papers.” He asked whether the buyer had a U.S. passport. I said of course, and the underwriter said a copy would be sufficient. I’m not sure why he asked for documents from only one of the buyers, as they are both on the mortgage. Is this standard procedure? It seems like a bigoted practice. A: The request for “naturalization papers” for only one buyer could be a case of discrimination, but it depends on the details of the mortgage application and the intent of the underwriter. “A lender, dealer, or broker cannot discriminate on the basis of national origin, but they are allowed to ask about permanent residency and immigration status,” said Stacey L. Tutt, senior staff attorney covering homeownership at the National Housing Law Project. While citizenship is not required to obtain a mortgage, immigration status is a factor in mortgage eligibility. In March, the Department of Housing and Urban Development updated its residency requirements for loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, “emphasizing the prioritization of federal resources to protect the financial interests of American citizens,” and eliminating eligibility for nonpermanent residents. The new HUD rules could lead to questions that unlawfully single someone out based on their nation of origin, accent or language, even though national origin is a legally protected class, Ms. Tutt said. Discriminatory questions could be targeted at U.S. citizens until their citizenship is established by the documents they submit. In this case, the underwriter’s selective request raises anti-discrimination concerns, particularly if the request was prompted by stereotypes regarding national origin, citizenship or immigration status, said Andrew Lieb, who practices discrimination law in New York. However, asking for naturalization papers or a passport is consistent with verifying identity necessary to underwrite the mortgage. It’s possible that the underwriter had sufficient identifying information for one buyer, but not the other. “Asking without discriminatory animus is not discrimination,” Mr. Lieb said. To prove discrimination, you’d have to show that one protected class was deliberately treated differently. If the underwriter had been more transparent about the rules and why they requested documents for only one buyer, they could have avoided the appearance of discrimination, said Anna DeSimone , who writes books about mortgages and fair lending. “‘This is standard and applies to everyone’ is the only thing people need to hear,” she said. If you suspect that your clients were treated unfairly, you can refer them to your local fair housing center so an expert can look at their case.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/26/realestate/25re-ASK-illo/25re-ASK-illo-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp

The home’s cladding, in industrial long-run steel, contrasts with the timber-slat construction of neighboring homes. One of roughly 300 suburbs that make up greater Auckland, Westmere is about three miles west of the Central Business District, Auckland’s commercial, cultural and financial hub. Cox’s Bay Reserve , a 35-acre waterside park, is a short walk from the house. The Auckland Zoo is a mile west. Nearby Garnet Road has a cluster of Westmere’s restaurants, including the Thai newcomer Esarn Rocket as well as Catroux , a popular all-day cafe. The local branch of Farro , a New Zealand supermarket chain, is just east. The sellers are the third owners of the house, which was built in 2012. After barring most foreign buyers in 2018, New Zealand this year relaxed its rules around property ownership. The revised golden visa allows foreigners to buy homes worth at least 5 million New Zealand dollars ($2.87 million), with residency requirements cut from three years to three weeks. Size: 2,206 square feet Price per square foot: $1,300 Indoors: The lower section of the two-level house resembles a glass cube. Floor-to-ceiling windows surround an open living-dining space with terrazzo floors and an integrated fireplace. The kitchen area has a stainless-steel island, with Fisher & Paykel appliances concealed behind tall cabinet doors. There is a half-bathroom on this floor. French oak steps lead to the second level, which has all three bedrooms, including a principal bedroom with an en suite bathroom whose shower is behind a mirrored wall. The other two bedrooms share a bathroom. Outdoor space: A covered terrace off the primary suite is cocooned in hardwood and overlooks a stone deck in irregular “crazy paving” beside a 26-foot-long swimming pool. A steel spiral staircase protrudes from the house to connect both levels. Inspired by the home’s shape, squared-off shrubs and hedges designed by the landscape architect Dana Johnston surround the 0.15-acre lot. Costs: Annual property taxes, known as the Auckland Council Tax in this region, total $4,595 (NZD $8,000). Lawyers represent both buyers and sellers in New Zealand property transactions. There are no additional taxes or fees for foreign buyers, and only sellers pay an agent’s commission. Legal fees on a property transaction typically total about $1,150 to $2,300 (NZD $2,000 to $4,000).

49,"In Senior Homes, A.I. Technology Is Sensing Falls Before They Happen",Joyce Cohen,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/realestate/in-senior-homes-ai-technology-is-sensing-falls-before-they-happen.html,2025-10-29,"AI technology is being deployed in senior living homes to sense falls. At The Bristal, residents like 81-year-old Kathy Doyle use a system employing motion sensors to monitor gait, posture, and movement patterns that could predict a fall. If a fall occurs, it immediately alerts staff. Ms. Doyle's sister reported her falls significantly decreased from every 4-6 weeks to once in the past year after using the system. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state falls are the leading cause of injury-related deaths for people aged 65 and over, with Dr. Jing Wang highlighting associated hospitalization risks for this population. This technology represents an advance over older emergency alert systems.",,The New York Times,Public/Private Development,"Kathy Doyle fell on the street in Manhattan several times over the years. Usually, she’d end up at Lenox Hill Hospital, disoriented and upset. Then she had a stroke. She kept falling, often injuring herself and scaring her family. So in 2023, Ms. Doyle, now 81, moved to a luxury assisted-living home a few blocks away from her longtime home on the Upper East Side. At the Bristal , residents can opt in to use a high-tech fall-detection system that employs a motion sensor to monitor gait, posture and patterns of movement that could portend a fall. If a resident does fall, it alerts building staff immediately. “This system has been a godsend for Kathy,” said Ms. Doyle’s sister, Patricia Doherty. “I think she had one fall in the past year. Before that, it was every four to six weeks.” Falls can be crippling, or worse: They’re the leading cause of injury-related deaths for people age 65 and over, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It is more than just a broken bone,” said Dr. Jing Wang , dean of the Florida State University College of Nursing, who specializes in the use of technology for aging adults. “A hospitalization might result in surgery and higher risks of infection for this frail population. These 80-plus seniors can never go back to their life before the fall.” Today’s anti-fall technology has come a long way from the emergency alert systems of the late 1980s, when Mrs. Fletcher uttered her iconic TV-commercial cry: “I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!” That kind of pendant or bracelet, or even a voice-activated system, is useless for someone who is injured, unconscious or too weak to trigger it.

50,How an NYC Neighborhood Engineers the Ultimate Halloween Spectacle,Gina Ryder and Hiroko Masuike,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/29/realestate/halloween-decoration-upper-west-side.html,2025-10-29,"Manhattan's West 69th Street transforms into an elaborate Halloween spectacle, drawing over 4,000 children for trick-or-treating. The West 69th Street Block Association, founded in 1969, organizes this annual event and a decoration competition that has fostered inter-building rivalries for 15 years. Residents like Vanessa Hicks spend thousands on elaborate themes, while others, such as those at 66 West 69th Street, collaborate on themed performances, including an Elvis dance routine. Max Szadek crafts large-scale paper art installations, and Maria Paskowitz creates intricate displays like an ""Ancient Rome"" colosseum. The tradition is seen as a community service and a way to unite the block.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"Vanessa Hicks isn’t a Halloween person. She has never been into the holiday’s campiness. Yet, Ms. Hicks, an executive coach, has spent thousands of dollars every October for the past 15 years on candy and elaborate decorations outside her home on West 69th Street in Manhattan. Halloween is a special holiday for many New York City neighborhoods, with city dwellers decking out brownstones and Victorians, rowhouses and high-rises. But West 69th Street, especially between Broadway and Central Park West on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, transforms into an open-air museum of Halloween art. Part haunted carnival and part design showcase, the scene can include professional aerialists rappelling from brownstones, doormen donning gorilla costumes and aliens dancing under a disco ball. When Ms. Hicks, 56, moved in 15 years ago, someone from the West 69th Street Block Association explained participation is technically voluntary, but most neighbors don’t dream of opting out. Last year, she collaborated with her 80-year-old neighbor, Irene Pletka, to create a “WITCHES” theme — an acronym for “women in total control of themselves.” Inspired by JD Vance’s “childless cat ladies” comment, the display included a banner featuring Oprah, Julia Child and Emily Dickinson. This year, her theme is Hitchcock films. Formed in 1969, the block association has nurtured a Halloween tradition dating back to 1971. Each year, its Halloween committee organizes a trick-or-treating affair that draws more than 4,000 children — a celebration many neighbors see as both a community service and a way to bring the block together. Around 15 years ago, the association began awarding prizes to the top three best-decorated buildings. Now a hallmark of the annual ritual, the competition has created inter-building rivalries, and residents go to great lengths to win. In September, over chocolate chip cookies and cans of LaCroix, the residents of 66 West 69th Street gathered in Lucy Head’s apartment to pick a theme from nine possibilities, including “MoMA” and “Harry Potter,” using the following ranked criteria: Will kids like it, are costumes affordable, and can it win? The group settled on Elvis, with 69.6 percent of the vote. Ms. Head, 41, who is a singer and researcher, bought a bag of Elvis wigs from Abracadabra, a costume store in Chelsea. By early October, it was time to decide how to decorate and what costumes to buy. This time, the crew gathered in Anthony Bracco’s apartment, and Ms. Head projected her laptop screen onto the TV. With her Canva account open to a mock-up featuring a photo of the building’s exterior with a Vegas backdrop, an Eiffel Tower and the name Elvis in bright red glitter lights, everyone talked over each other about what they did and didn’t like. Finally, they zeroed in on Vegas. With laptops open as if in a work meeting, Mr. Bracco, 46, a sales adviser at Oscar de la Renta, ordered a red velvet curtain for the front door. Tom Garbett, 29, a photographer for the Brooklyn Nets, ordered a 20-foot backdrop for $250 to hang on the building’s exterior. Now it was time to assign everyone Elvis iterations: Vegas, Jailhouse Rock, Comeback Special, Blue Hawaii and Sparkly Gold. “I need a fake hairy chest!” said Zoë Thompson, 30, a producer, who settled on Vegas Elvis. Someone dared to suggest ordering a fog machine, and Mr. Bracco immediately rebuked them. “Every time we’ve tried the fog machine, it has never worked,” yelled Mr. Bracco. “And we tried it on three separate occasions!” At the close of the meeting, Ms. Head had everyone promise to order their costumes, devise a plan for adding more sideburns to their wigs, and come limber for the next gathering: dance practice. On Oct. 15 at 8:30 p.m., nine residents gathered to learn a two-minute, 30-second dance routine to a medley of Elvis songs, choreographed by Max Kravchenko, 28, a ballroom dance instructor at Fred Astaire Dance Studios who has lived in the building for two years. Over clips of “Viva Las Vegas,” “Hound Dog,” “A Little Less Conversation” and “Jailhouse Rock,” Mr. Kravchenko shouted cues. “Sashay! Sashay! Swing the mic,” he said. “With the hip!” Sweaty and out of breath from 90 minutes of dancing, the crew agreed to have a dress rehearsal on Oct. 23. “Wait, can you show us the jackhammer? I feel like I’m not getting it,” Ms. Thompson, dressed in a white bell-bottom jumpsuit with flutter sleeves, asked Mr. Kravchenko. The crew agreed to practice one more time before Halloween, when they will take their show outside to perform on trash cans in front of the building. Max Szadek started planning for Halloween last November. He collected paper grocery bags from H-Mart and Pioneer to make paper dresses for the sheep he planned to build from recycled materials for an exhibition he titled “Little Bo Peep Who Lost Her Sheep That Ran Away and Went to the Masquerade.” Inspired by the Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave , who created historical costumes out of paper recreations, Mr. Szadek, 62, wanted to create an exhibition using mostly paper and recycled materials. A celebrity assistant to Itzhak Perlman, the Israeli-American violinist, Mr. Szadek works out of his office on West 69th Street and lives in Murray Hill, Manhattan. When not on tour with Mr. Perlman, he spent many weekends and evenings working on his Halloween creations. The four sheep were created to resemble the following: Scarlett O’Hara from the picnic scene in “Gone With the Wind”; Mary Poppins; Truly Scrumptious, a character from the film “Chitty Chitty Bang Bang”; and the Day of the Dead. Last year, Mr. Szadek, a former costume designer, won the block’s décor contest for his Princess Frog installation, inspired by the “Frog Prince” fairy tale. “That win pierced my heart,” he said. ​​And yet he felt undeserving and wanted to deliver again this year. He said, “I need to show that I was worthy of the prize.” Mr. Szadek hand-painted and decoupaged the sheep’s dresses, sealing them with polyurethane after testing nearly a dozen designs. He began making art in 2018, inspired by Halloween on West 69th Street. “The joy I saw from the kids, the community, and the neighborhood spirit of the street. It’s so great to just do something for the sheer joy of making it,” he said. “Lots of people have said to me, like, ‘Oh, you should put your stuff in a museum.’ And I’m like, ‘I have the greatest exhibit of my life.’” In 2018, he found out his office building was doing a ghost theme but didn’t need any more items, leaving Mr. Szadek devastated that his various ghost creations were superfluous. His friend Lauren Rick, then a dog walker in the neighborhood, walked him around to five different potential new display spots, from flower beds to open entrances. “She was like a real estate agent,” he said. Eileen Vazquez, the current block association president, suggested her building, where Mr. Szadek has exhibited his work for the last three years. The Paskowitz brownstone sits between Broadway and Columbus Avenue. It is the kind of place strangers visit to take their annual Christmas card photos. Neighbors slow down to admire the mums as they walk their dogs. But inside, Maria Paskowitz is starting to panic. She’s sitting at her computer at her dining room table, which is covered in craft supplies and hand-drawn mock-ups. It’s early October, and two merlot-colored king sheet sets sewn together cover the living and dining room floors. Furniture is pushed aside. Ms. Paskowitz, 51, plans to fashion the sheet sets into a flag as part of her Ancient Rome theme. Large sheets of paper are on the floor, filled with fractions written in pencil. To measure a flag 350 inches tall and 250 inches wide, she calculated the ratios between the paper’s measurements and the flag’s size, then transposed them. “Every year, I’m like, I’m never doing this again. This was a mistake. I’m just gonna throw some cobwebs on the house. And then every year, I don’t follow my own advice, and I do it again,” she said. Ms. Paskowitz, whose history-loving high schooler plans to dress as Julius Caesar, has just a few weeks left to turn the exterior of the brownstone where she’s lived for the past decade into a colosseum. She is collaborating with her neighbor, Elizabeth Styron, whose children, aged 9, 13 and 17, will dress as gladiators prepared for combat and a chariot race. In 2015, when they moved to the block, the Paskowitz family kicked things off with a “Ghostbusters” theme, complete with a giant Marshmallow Man bursting from the window, followed by a whimsical Candy Land display for a few years. Later, Ms. Styron discovered their kids attended the same school, and the two teamed up. One year, they recreated “It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown,” with over 40 glowing jack-o’-lanterns and the film projected across their houses. As a kid, Ms. Paskowitz loved doing arts and crafts, but along the way, she lost sight of her creativity. Before becoming a stay-at-home mom, she graduated from M.I.T. and worked in software. Halloween’s endless knitting, painting and ideating helps her keep in touch with her creativity. “Even though I’m losing my mind sometimes, because there’s a deadline, right? I am enjoying it the whole time. I have this vision in my head. I’m getting all excited about it,” she said. On a Friday afternoon two weeks before the big day, Ms. Paskowitz set up a folding table on the landing of her home in between two cardboard columns and began setting the scene for a Roman banquet. She placed skeletons in togas and crowns fit for a Roman goddess at the table for a rehearsal dinner of sorts to see how they held up in the wind. Neighbors stopped to take photos and compliment the tableau. Suddenly, a gust of wind sent a cardboard column tumbling, nearly into a red ceramic amphora. Ms. Paskowitz resolved to put 10-pound weights inside to keep them upright. Her super, Sergio Andrade, 46, helped secure the column to the stairs with fishing wire while she tied down the skeletons to hold them steady. “Next year, I’ll learn,” she joked. “You’ll never learn,” a voice from the street said. It was Larry Marx, 84, a former block association president who lived down the street for 40 years. He said, “The block gets us all.” For more coverage of neighborhoods that go all out for Halloween, check out this guide .",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/28/multimedia/28re-69thst-halloween-lbjw/28re-69thst-halloween-lbjw-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp

The asking price for the late-19th-century home is $7.995 million, more than double the $3.35 million purchase price four years ago. Carl Gambino of Compass is the listing broker.

The tone was far less jovial in the title track to Ms. Allen’s album, which intimated that the decision to buy the brownstone was largely Mr. Harbour’s. Now I’m looking at houses with four or five floors And you’ve found us a brownstone, said ‘You want it?

55,Aging in Place Doesn’t Mean Making Your Home ‘Soulless’,Dina Cheney,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/realestate/how-to-age-in-place-stylish.html,2025-10-31,"A 2024 AARP survey found most older Americans want to age in place, yet fewer than 4 percent of homes have basic accessibility. Experts note traditional retrofits are often unappealing. However, homeowners and designers are creating stylish, functional solutions. Ava Abramowitz and Neil Rackham built an ADA-compliant home with integrated features like a camouflaged ramp and lighted handrails. Designer Conway Van der Wolk uses vintage statues as supports and subtle angled wood transitions. Other innovations include lever hardware, offset door hinges, smart home technology, and slip-resistant flooring. Designers also integrate stylish grab bars, curbless showers, and comfort-height toilets. These examples show aging-in-place modifications can be beautiful, not ""soulless.""",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Most older Americans want to age in place, electing to remain in their homes rather than move into senior housing facilities, according to a 2024 survey by AARP, the advocacy organization focused on older Americans. Yet fewer than 4 percent of American homes have basic accessibility features. “It’s a really dire situation,” said Jennifer Molinsky, director of the Housing an Aging Society Program at Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies. Until flexible homes become the norm, most homeowners will need to retrofit their spaces. Common solutions, like aluminum ramps, clunky steel grab bars and motorized stair lifts, tend to be eyesores and constant reminders of mobility challenges. These institutional-looking features can also make seniors feel embarrassed or more vulnerable to crime. “Many homes renovated to help people age are soulless,” said Ava Abramowitz, 76, who is the author of “The Architect’s Essentials of Negotiation” and a former deputy general counsel of the American Institute of Architects. But some homeowners and designers believe they don’t have to choose between form and function. Ms. Abramowitz, who is also a mediator for the District of Columbia federal courts and a lecturer at George Washington University Law School, and her husband, Neil Rackham, 82, who is an author and academic, are among those who wanted to find another way. When they began conceptualizing a home they were building in Northern Virginia with the design-build firm Gruver Cooley and the landscape architecture firm River’s Edge Landscapes, they made aging in place a priority. “Everything is quietly compliant with A.D.A. guidelines,” said Ms. Abramowitz, referring to the Americans With Disabilities Act. “We wanted to show retired people can take care of themselves in a beautiful way.” Here are seamless and stylish ways, both small and large, to age in place. The interior designer Conway Van der Wolk, who contracted polio as a child and has had mobility challenges since, has adapted her 125-year-old cottage on Cape Cod, Mass. “There hasn’t been a playbook for me,” she said. “I’ve figured out creative ways that are helpful but don’t cry out” as accessibility features. One way was to line the steps into her pool and by her front and back doors with matching pairs of vintage statues and finials. These supports disguised as art help her feel more secure and stable, she said. Similar items can be found at salvage yards or garden stores or online for $100 or less. Ms. Van der Wolk, 58, also made changes inside, where not all the floors are the same height. She painted the wood floors in the living room a gray and white diamond pattern and chose gray wood tile for the floor in the adjoining family room and kitchen, which are at a slightly different elevation. Then she installed a painted angled piece of wood on the threshold between the rooms. “It’s very subtle,” she said. “My eye is drawn to it, so it helps me look down, and the slant helps me not trip.” While residing in a multilevel home in Virginia, Ms. Van der Wolk realized she would benefit from having railings on both sides of her staircase, so she had a secondary rail constructed out of nautical rope attached to the wall with brass rings — a practical, economical and stylish solution. At Knot & Rope Supply, two-inch rope runs $3.50 per foot and rope brackets start from $17. Don’t underestimate the power of hardware, from brass rings to lever drawer pulls. “As people age and get arthritis in their hands, levers are so much more functional than having to twist a knob,” said Nicole Morrison, owner of Red Ladder Residential, a general contractor company in North Carolina. “We are changing out all door hardware to levers for clients in their 60s or above.” Ms. Morrison, 61, who incorporates aging-in-place principles in most of her projects, also found a way to create wider door openings without reframing doorways. In a recent bathroom project for a client whose daughter is in a wheelchair, she replaced the standard door hinges with offset hinges, which enable doors to swing a full 180 degrees and lay flat against the wall. A pack can run for about $40 . Ample lighting and technology can be both sleek and helpful. “A smart doorbell with a speaker and camera means you don’t have to get up to answer the door as often,” said Rodney Harrell, vice president of family, home and community at AARP. Voice-activated lighting and thermostats and motorized blinds provide functionality. Finally, inject some color and personality, said Stephen Priest, who lost both legs while serving in the Army and now works as a designer specializing in health-care architecture at Material Design Architects in San Diego. “Color on the wall looks beautiful and can also help people with memory or vision issues find their way,” said Mr. Priest, who advocates for accessibility and inclusive design. Building new will usually yield the most accessible home with hallways, doorways and aisles wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. “Starting with a clean slate was the only way to build the home we wanted,” said Louie Delaware, 68, the president and founder of the Living in Place Institute, which coaches and certifies contractors and designers in accessible solutions. (The Certified Aging-in-Place Specialist credential program from the National Association of Home Builders is similar.) Mr. Delaware recently built a “forever” multistory home in Colorado for himself and his wife, Judy Delaware, 67, an occupational therapist. “Our goal was to make a home that does not look like something out of a rehab or hospital setting,” he said. Since his family’s home is multilevel, Mr. Delaware decided to frame and wire the area around the staircase to later accommodate a pneumatic elevator. These tubelike glass or acrylic conveyances look sleek and modern, and generally take up less space than traditional elevators, Mr. Delaware said. Still, they cost $45,000 on average, according to the home-improvement service Angi , generally more than a traditional elevator, and like all elevators, they are usually pricier when added to an existing home. The Abramowitz-Rackham home also includes an elevator, which makes stops at all three levels, including a basement with an apartment for a potential live-in aide. There are also staircases with handrails inset with lighting, an original design. When the motion detectors sense movement, the railings illuminate. “They’re so special, our dogs wait for the lights to turn on before they go downstairs,” Ms. Abramowitz said. “It was very expensive, but a manufacturer could do it relatively cheaply.” In the front yard, the couple had a ramp built into a stone pathway surrounded by plants, camouflaging the accessibility feature. Along with ramps and safer stairways, flooring can help ease mobility and reduce falls. Prioritize slip-resistant materials, Mr. Delaware said. For many rooms in his home, he selected luxury vinyl planking, which he attached using adhesive. If the planks are snapped together instead, the seams can split over time from wheelchair use, he said. Waterproof vinyl tiles , which resemble marble, can cost $1.49 per square foot, for example. In bathrooms, choose showers, which are safer than tubs, said Ms. Morrison, the general contractor. If possible, opt for one with a curbless design and sufficient interior space for a wheelchair or aide, she added. Don’t neglect grab bars. If they’re in the same material and finish as the surrounding bathroom fixtures, they should blend in. For instance, the Armand Grab Bar ($200) comes in oil-rubbed bronze, chrome, and brushed nickel. Or make grab bars a striking design element. For a client’s shower, Matthias Hollwich, founding principal of the Manhattan-based firm HWKN Architecture, created a black grab bar inset with lighting. “It looked awesome,” said Mr. Hollwich, who is also a co-author of “New Aging: Live Smarter Now to Live Better Forever.” “You could hold onto it, but it was more of an aesthetic element. This secondary light washed over the wall, for a beautiful atmosphere.” Including both a detachable hand-held shower head and a stationary shower head will appear luxurious, plus accommodate standing and seated positions. In showers, Christopher Boutlier, an interior designer based in Washington, D.C., often includes built-in benches. “We design the bench in the same stone or tile as the surround, so it looks intentional,” he said. The acclaimed interior decorator Vicente Wolf incorporated a large, curved niche with an Indian lattice window into the shower in his Manhattan apartment. The niche doubles as seating and a sculptural focal point. Comfort-height toilets are taller and generally more accessible than standard toilets, said Ms. Morrison, who also recommends a nearby grab bar. Standard toilets are lower, so “you have to put an ugly hospital seat on top, since it’s too far to bend down and lift yourself up,” she said. Expect to spend about $50 to $100 more for a comfort-height toilet and $100 to $300 more for a wheelchair-friendly toilet with a grab bar. In kitchens, storage and appliance drawers in lower cabinetry and pull-down shelving in upper cabinetry help with accessibility, Mr. Delaware said. Induction burners are not only sleek in design, but they can also be a boon for safety since they’re free of open flames and hot coils. But they are typically pricier: A new unit with multiple induction burners can cost up to $3,000. The designer Laura Lubin, who founded the Nashville-based firm Ellerslie Interiors, incorporated an induction cooktop in the kitchen and bar area of a pool house that will eventually house its owners, a couple who plans to age in place. Fortunately, they won’t have to sacrifice style in the process.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/02/multimedia/31re-ageinplace-style-cjhm/31re-ageinplace-style-cjhm-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
56,The Last Columns of Brooklyn Heights,Rukmini Callimachi,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/realestate/greek-revival-townhouse-brooklyn-heights.html,2025-10-31,"A Greek Revival home at #46 Willow Place in Brooklyn Heights, built in the 1840s, has been listed for sale this month for just over $3.4 million by Brian Palmer and his sister. The house, described as appearing on the verge of collapse with peeling green paint on its columns, is the last holdout of what was once a set of four colonnaded homes. Its condition, including warped linoleum and cloth wiring, reflects its need for a complete overhaul, contributing to its lower price compared to neighboring properties. The Palmers’ parents bought the house for $50,000 in 1969. The home stands as a unique example of the Greek Revival style.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"One guidebook to New York City describes the house in Brooklyn Heights as follows: “Across the street is lovely #46, looking for all the world like a set from ‘Gone with the Wind.’” The Greek Revival home in question, which appears as if it’s on the verge of collapse — its columns cloaked in peeling green paint — is wedged between two, hulking modernist townhouses and is the lone holdout of what was once a set of four colonnaded homes facing a parallel row across the street. It was built in the 1840s, when there were still outhouses because homes did not have indoor plumbing, before the telephone and the electric bulb were invented and decades before construction began on the Brooklyn Bridge. Nearly two centuries later, the house was put up for sale this month by Brian Palmer and his sister, whose mother had lived there until shortly before her death last year at age 98. Priced at just over $3.4 million , 46 Willow Place is listed for less than a third of what the house immediately to its left fetched in 2024 — $10.6 million . Its lower price reflects the rowhouse’s need for a complete overhaul. Inside, the linoleum is warped and bumpy, some of the light fixtures still have cloth wiring and the oven hasn’t been changed since the 1960s. “My sister and I grew up there, hiding behind the pillars of the twin-story porch as guides stopped out front and told groups of tourists that the house was haunted,” Mr. Palmer, 61, wrote in an email. “Other passers-by would tell us that ours was their favorite house in the city and that we should never refurbish it to look like the flawless quartet of houses across the street.” Mr. Palmer’s parents — Bob and Ina Palmer, a psychologist and New York City tour guide — bought the rowhouse for $50,000 in 1969, about $450,000 adjusted for inflation. Back then, songs in Spanish wafted over the backyard from the largely Puerto Rican neighborhood nearby, said Mr. Palmer, who was 4 when he moved in, alongside his sister Cynthia, then 3. At the time of purchase, the green pillars of the house were already chipping and would never be repainted. The columns that both tourists and famous photographers stopped to capture are rare in Brooklyn now, but they were all the rage in the 1840s when the building was built. The popularity of the style, borrowed from Athens, can be traced to a book published in 1762 by two British architects who traveled to Greece and took careful measurements of temples, reproducing the exact proportions in plates. Their work, “The Antiquities of Athens,” made its way across the Atlantic, where it served as a blueprint for pattern books. By the 1800s, Greek Revival had swept across the United States. For a country that was then only a few decades old and emerging from war with the British monarchy, adopting the style of ancient Greece — the birthplace of democracy — was a way to assert the nation’s new identity. “People who built houses, churches and civic buildings based on Greek temple forms expressed their belief that America was becoming a great civilization, one that would rival the glories of the ancient past,” according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s description of the style. Churches, banks and government buildings were built in this style, including the Ohio and Vermont Statehouses, the North Carolina State Capitol and the U.S. Patent Office in Washington, whose architect reportedly bragged that the building’s proportions were “ exactly those of the Parthenon in Athens .” The craze began in the 1820s and continued into the 1850s. Smack in the middle of this period is when the house at No. 46 Willow was built. Its exact origin is blurry. One book claims it was built in 1846. The listing by Compass says 1849. The architect is also unknown, although the biography of Anson Blake — an early developer of southern Brooklyn who made his fortune selling straw hats at a markup before becoming a real estate speculator — describes how he owned the colonnaded homes in the 1850s. What’s clear is that the home was built not as a one-off but as a set: four colonnaded homes on the east side of the street facing a mirror image to the west. The row facing No. 46 remains intact and is memorialized in one of Berenice Abbott’s photographs , now held by the Met. But today, No. 46 is the only one of its group left on the opposite side. Though it was built in a grand style, No. 46 was always a modest example of that grandeur. Its columns are made of wood, not marble — more aspiration than affluence. After they bought the house, the Palmers discovered that the old porcelain sink had cracks in it, filled with glue. One of the few changes the family made was replacing the broken sink with a stainless steel one from Sears. At Stuyvesant High School, Mr. Palmer began an environmental magazine, which his sister took over two years later. It grew, with some issues spanning 76 pages. “So instead of fixing up the house, we had 16 kids sleeping over for layout weekend,” he said. They were busy with their lives, but in the background hovered a frugality imposed by the stories their family carried into No. 46: One grandfather, scarred by wartime scarcity, insisted on washing sandwich wrappers and hanging them to dry on a clothesline so they could be reused. Their mother, the daughter of a Jewish intellectual from Czechoslovakia, showed them how to make flowers out of tissue paper — it’s what her family did to eke out a living in New York after escaping the Holocaust. When Mr. Palmer hid behind the pillars and listened to tour guides describing his family home, a mix of conflicting emotions washed over him: “We felt its uniqueness but we also felt a bit ashamed that it was not up to the standards of rest of the street,” he said. Still, the tour groups kept coming, drawn by the same magnetism that kept the house and its columns standing. “The oddity of this one is its story — it’s the surviving one,” said Patrick Ciccone, a co-author of a book about New York rowhouses and brownstones that includes a section on the colonnaded row. “It’s like one tooth out of a smile.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/31/multimedia/31re-colonnadedhouseALT-hqct/31re-colonnadedhouseALT-hqct-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
57,The Best States for Retirement,Arnesa A. Howell,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/30/realestate/best-states-for-retirement.html,2025-10-30,"An annual WalletHub study, utilizing data from sources like the U.S. Census Bureau and CDC, ranks Florida as the best state for retirement. The study assessed states across three weighted categories: affordability, quality of life, and health care, using 46 metrics including tax friendliness and hospital quality. Florida ranked highly for its sunny environment, friendly tax code (no state income, inheritance, or estate taxes), and amenities for seniors. Minnesota placed second, excelling in health care. Colorado finished third, noted for health care and lack of estate or inheritance taxes. Wyoming was fourth, offering high affordability and quality of life but lower health care access. South Dakota ranked fifth.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"With its sunny beaches and friendly tax code, Florida is the best state to retire in, according to an annual study by WalletHub . But if you’re looking for a lower cost of living and you don’t mind experiencing all four seasons, you can find excellent alternatives in Western and Midwestern states. Using data culled from a host of sources including the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the study assessed each state across three main weighted categories: affordability, quality of life and health care. Within these categories were 46 secondary metrics, such as share of population age 65 and older, quality of public hospitals and general tax friendliness. Florida has sun and sand, yes. But it also has the third highest percentage of older residents and plenty for them to do. And then there’s what it doesn’t have: state income, inheritance or estate taxes. “There’s a lot of talk in Florida now about doing away with property taxes, which would make it even more appealing to retirees,” said Chip Lupo, a WalletHub analyst, though he cautioned that high prices are spurring some retirees to look elsewhere. Minnesota is colder and less tax friendly, but it finished in second place thanks to its stellar health care, with the highest number of facilities (including the original and largest Mayo Clinic campus) and the second most nursing homes of any state. Overall, its seniors are healthier and safer. Colorado, with its excellent health care and lack of estate or inheritance taxes, finished third, followed by Wyoming and South Dakota. Wyoming was found to be the most affordable state and offered a high quality of life, but it finished 38th in health care, “because it’s sparsely populated and access might be a problem,” Mr. Lupo said. South Dakota scored points for its many employed seniors, a strong nursing work force and its top-ranked geriatric hospitals.

Located in the West Village, the 9.5-foot-wide property was built in 1873 and spans approximately 1,000 square feet over three levels, featuring three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and four fireplaces. Notable past residents include Cary Grant, John Barrymore, and poet Edna St. Vincent Millay. Dr. Tandra Hammer and Donte Calarco, real estate investors, purchased the house in 2023 for $3.41 million. Annual property taxes are $21,190. Cortnee Glasser of Sotheby’s International Realty is the listing agent.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Long before the tiny-home movement, there was 75½ Bedford Street, a Dutch-style gabled house wedged between two other residences in the heart of Manhattan’s West Village. A mere 9.5 feet wide, and even leaner inside, it is known as the narrowest townhouse in New York City . Despite its slim figure, the red brick structure has housed some big personalities over the years, among them the actors Cary Grant and John Barrymore, the anthropologist Margaret Mead and the cartoonist William Steig. The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay lived in the house in 1923 and 1924, during which time she wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning “The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver,” as affirmed by a plaque above the front door. A celebrity in its own right, the quirky home is now ready for its next resident. It’s back on the market with a not-so-tiny $4.195 million price tag. Annual property taxes are $21,190. “There are some people who don’t want a narrow home,” said Cortnee Glasser of Sotheby’s International Realty, the listing agent, “and there are others who will appreciate its charm and history. They would love to have a townhouse on one of the most desirable blocks in the West Village for $4.195 million.” Built in 1873 and known as the Millay House, it stands between Commerce and Morton Streets, on what was once a carriage entryway for neighboring 77 Bedford, Greenwich Village’s oldest surviving house. In the 1920s, when Millay and her husband, Eugen Jan Boissevain, a coffee importer, lived there, it underwent several changes, including the addition of the gabled roof, Dutch doors and the creation of a writer’s studio with a skylight on the top floor. Wood casement windows were also added to each story. Measuring around 1,000 square feet over three levels, 75½ Bedford has three bedrooms, two full bathrooms and four wood-burning fireplaces, including one in the bathroom of the second-floor primary suite. There is also a finished basement with a sleeping area and laundry. A small private garden off the eat-in kitchen is landscaped with boxwoods and potted flowering annuals, and accesses a larger garden shared with two neighboring homes. There are balconies off the top two bedroom floors. Dr. Tandra Hammer, an obstetrician and gynecologist, bought the house in 2023 for $3.41 million. Her daughter, Donte Calarco, lives there most of the year. The two are avid real estate investors. “We love the city, and we love flipping old houses,” said Ms. Calarco, a former actress and a part-time real estate agent in Camden, Maine. Dr. Hammer, whose primary residence is in Nashville, uses it mainly as a pied-à-terre. They’re now looking to buy another home in Lower Manhattan, though on just one level. “We’re ready for our next project,” Ms. Calarco said. Although the townhouse had been meticulously renovated by the previous owners, Ms. Calarco and Dr. Hammer continued making improvements, like updating the electrical system and renovating the closets. “We didn’t really do tons of work, we just kind of took it from there to make it more livable,” Ms. Calarco said. They were initially drawn to the “authentic charm” of the house, she said: “There’s so much history — you could feel it.” To that end, some early architectural flourishes remain, like the wood-beam ceilings, wide-plank white oaks floors, winding staircase and Dutch doors. More recent finishes can be found in the marble bathrooms and kitchen. People who pass by the famous skinny house, part of the Greenwich Village Historic District, also seem to feel it. “They’re outside taking pictures,” Ms. Calarco said. “Some people might see that as a negative, but I don’t. It’s just part of the character and spirit of the neighborhood.” Andrew Berman, the director of Village Preservation, a group that focuses on architecture in Greenwich Village, the East Village and NoHo, would agree. “It’s really an icon of the neighborhood,” he said. “It speaks to the quirkiness and charm.” The interior of the house has an open floor plan. Not surprisingly, it includes plenty of built-in storage and pocket doors to maximize living space. Ceiling heights range from a little over seven feet in the basement to around 12 feet to the skylight on the third floor. There is enough space to fit queen-size beds in each of the bedrooms, according to Ms. Calarco. “It’s a queen bed house,” she said. “A king would be a little too hard to move around with.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/09/multimedia/03re-exclusive-narrowhouse-gqkc/03re-exclusive-narrowhouse-gqkc-superJumbo-v2.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp

62,Let’s Learn How to Paint Furniture,Tim Heffernan and Clark Hodgin,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/31/realestate/lets-learn-how-to-paint-furniture.html,2025-10-31,"The article, ""Let’s Learn How to Paint Furniture,"" dated October 31, 2025, details the author's experience painting an old wood chair bright green. The author advises against using a chair for a first project, suggesting simpler items like picture frames or footstools. It outlines tools, including carbide scrapers, sandpaper, waterborne paints, and synthetic brushes, and describes four steps: prepping, priming, and applying two coats of finish. The author experimented with professional paints from Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore, which performed better than the Behr paint initially used. Despite challenges, the author achieved a ""neat and glossy"" result.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"I painted this chair so you don’t have to. Last month, out of nowhere, the urge hit me to paint the old wood chair bright green. It was the first time I’d ever painted a piece of furniture, and now that I’m finished, my advice is: Don’t pick a chair for your first project. I’ve never spent more time on a paint job in my life. (More on that later.) But I’ve rarely learned as much from a project. This month’s column is nominally about painting furniture the old-fashioned way — by hand, with a brush, for a characterful finish — but it’s just as much about the process of self-education that’s at the heart of DIY. I really didn’t know what I was doing when I began. After experimenting and taking time to understand the mistakes I’d made, I came to know quite a lot. If you’d like to give furniture painting a low-stakes try, poke around your local secondhand store. An unadorned picture frame, small trunk or simple footstool will allow you plenty of practice with the various skills without getting overwhelmed. A carbide paint scraper is great at removing old paint and varnish from flat and convex surfaces (like round chair legs). I avoid chemical paint strippers whenever possible. They’re messy, produce strong vapors (even the “green” varieties) and require a lot of cleanup. Use sandpaper in 150-grit and 320-grit varieties to smooth wood and paint primer, respectively. Use waterborne urethane or alkyd cabinet paint and primer . These produce minimal fumes (unlike solvent-based urethanes or oil enamels), and they dry quickly to a hard finish that resists abrasion, dirt, liquids and solvents. They’re also known for their ability to “lay down,” or flatten themselves out to a smooth finish, leaving just enough evidence of your brushstrokes to maintain a hand-painted character. A soft, angled paintbrush with synthetic (not natural) bristles is equally good at covering flat surfaces and getting into tight corners. A stubby-handled, two-inch version gave me the best control when painting my tiny chair. A three-inch brush with a longer handle would work better on a larger piece. Painting anything made of wood involves the same four steps: prepping, priming and laying down two coats of finish. Doing them well takes attention to detail, from the way the wood grain lies to the tools you choose and even the way you hold those tools. I prepared a simple pine board — a stand-in for a mangy old table or dresser you’ve decided to refinish — to demonstrate the basics of each. To get old finishes off concave surfaces and out of tight corners, you can use a smaller carbide scraper or a scraper with assorted steel blades, as seen in the video below. (My preference for the curvy chair was actually a set of cabinet scrapers, which are just thin sheets of spring steel and are amazingly versatile. You can see them in action farther down.) After scraping, sand the whole surface with 150-grit paper, following the direction of the wood grain to leave a smooth but slightly toothy finish for the primer to stick to. Brush on a layer of primer, using long strokes in the direction of the wood grain. Let it fully dry, then gently sand with 320-grit paper to knock down any high spots (again following the grain). On flat surfaces, back the sandpaper with a sanding block if you’d like — a piece of wood works well. Finally, dust every surface thoroughly with a clean, dry rag before starting to paint. The paint I’m using in the videos is Sherwin-Williams Emerald urethane trim enamel. It brushed on smoothly and laid down beautifully, leaving a glassy coat with subtle brush marks. So did Benjamin Moore Advance alkyd, which I subsequently took for a spin. Each costs considerably more than the Behr cabinet paint I used on the infamous chair, but there was a stark difference in ease of application and quality of finish. Whichever paint you use, work fairly quickly, trusting the paint to lay down and hide minor imperfections as it dries. Use long strokes — don’t dab — and try to always brush in the same direction. These specialty waterborne paints have a tendency to gum up and peel off the surface if you work them back and forth. Almost every piece of furniture is going to demand some deviation from the ground rules, and you’ll need to decide which of several routes to take. My chair odyssey offers several examples. You may need to first disassemble a piece of vintage furniture to make repairs. In that case, it can be quicker and easier to prep, prime and paint the parts individually before reassembling. Lay flat parts like panels and drawer fronts on clean cardboard; suspend table legs and other “in the round” parts on wires to give you access to all sides at once. I did disassemble the chair first, as most of the joints needed regluing. So it would better represent a thrift-store rescue, I put it back together before painting it, leaving only the seat off to give me better access to the framework beneath. (These old school-chair seats are just screwed on.) Some of the problems I ran into later would have been easier to deal with if I had painted it in pieces. Removing the old varnish with cabinet scrapers, as seen below, went quickly. The work was somewhat fussy, given all the tight corners at the joints, and I had to take care not to damage the wood. Paint stripper was an option, and it doesn’t damage wood, but using it would have meant coating all 50 of the chair’s varnished surfaces, waiting an hour for the stripper to work, wiping up the resulting goop, and then washing every surface with solvent to get the remnants of the stripper off. The Behr primer laid down nicely and needed only a few minutes of work with the 320-grit sandpaper to be ready for paint. The Behr paint, however, refused to cooperate. I started out using the same firm-bristled brush that had worked so well with the primer. The paint piled up in thick ridges separated by valleys where the primer showed through. I spent the next few days trying to find a different brush, or a combination of brushes, or some other adjustment that would make the paint behave. A soft round brush meant for painting chair spindles didn’t improve things, nor did a firm square brush meant for window frames, and their long handles were a hindrance in the chair’s tight quarters. The soft, stub-handled, angled brush produced a noticeably more even — though far from excellent — finish, and was much nimbler. I decided to stick with it. Against Behr’s instructions, I next tried the old trick of thinning the paint with a splash of water; that improved its lay-down but encouraged it to drip. But the little blue-handled brush in the photo above, which came out of a $6 grab bag from a hobby store, was a pleasant surprise. I found I could use it to get a thin layer of paint onto trouble spots, like the rounded edges of the chair rails. Following that with a sweep of the stubby angled brush produced a reasonably uniform finish. As it turns out, the “right brush” for any paint job is the one that works. So be ready to change your plans if you hit a roadblock. ’Tis a poor workman who blames his tools — but the only tool I never subbed out was the paint itself, and in hindsight I should have. The professional paints I tried later are simply better at the job, and would have spared me a lot of frustration. For all that, I’m mostly happy with my first stab at painting furniture. Up close, you can still see every brushstroke, but from any real distance the paint looks neat and glossy, and the chair itself is a jolly addition to the home. Besides, I’ll do a better job when I paint its twin.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/31/multimedia/31re-DIY-PAINT-01-hmpb/31re-DIY-PAINT-01-hmpb-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
67,An Investor Wants to Buy My Father’s House in Cash. Can I Trust It?,Jill Terreri Ramos,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/realestate/cash-for-your-home-offers.html,2025-11-01,"Companies are aggressively soliciting homeowners, particularly seniors, with cash offers to buy homes “as is” quickly, without closing costs or listing. These investor companies aim to buy low and sell high, often offering less than a property's worth and potentially embedding hidden fees. Experts from the National Housing Law Project and National Consumer Law Center advise caution, thorough research, and checking reviews. Real estate brokers, conversely, aim to sell homes at the highest price through market insights and competitive listing services, which can open properties to competitive bidding.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Q: Almost daily we are inundated with phone calls and mail from companies wanting to buy my elderly father’s home. They claim they will buy the house in cash “as is,” with no closing costs and no listing. I’ve also seen television advertisements for these companies. At some point I will need to sell the house and I wonder if these companies are legitimate. The house would need some rehabilitation before it could be listed by a real estate agent. I’m wondering what the deal is! A: Be wary of companies that aggressively solicit you and offer a quick sale. They’ll try to convince you that they’re your best option. Usually they’re not. These companies typically target seniors and other homeowners with a lot of equity in their property, but who may be in financial distress or otherwise feel pressure to sell. They’re investors — their business model is buying low and selling high. They offer less than what the home is worth in exchange for a quick sale where the seller doesn’t have to worry about repairs or paying a broker to list the property. “Their tactic is to make you feel that they’re the only ones who could help you with this,” said Stacey L. Tutt, senior staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project. Some use deceptive methods or press sellers into making a decision before they can gather all of the facts. “Many of these investors add in a 6 or 7 percent fee that gets buried in the fine print, eliminating the only possible benefit of not listing the home with a Realtor,” said Sarah Bolling Mancini, managing director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center. When you hire a broker, they have an incentive (and the tools) to sell your home at the highest possible price, in exchange for a negotiated commission. They can give you insight into the local market, like what comparable homes are selling for and how sales have been trending. They can also list your home on the multiple listing service, opening it up to a competitive bidding process. If you do consider a deal with one of these investment companies, be sure to research it thoroughly, read reviews and check their rating from the Better Business Bureau to see if they’ve received complaints. Ultimately, they’re looking to turn a profit on your property. “Homeowners are being bombarded by these solicitations because the investors doing it can make a ton of money this way,” Ms. Mancini said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/02/realestate/01re-ASK-illo/01re-ASK-illo-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
73,‘Dream Home Makeover’ Star Shea McGee Thinks Nothing Is Too Casual,Sydney Gore and Jason Henry,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/realestate/shea-mcgee-dream-home-makeover.html,2025-11-05,"Shea and Syd McGee sold their Orange County home, reinvesting in their 2014-founded design firm, Studio McGee. They expanded into e-commerce with McGee & Co. and formed a multiyear partnership with Target. In 2018, the McGees returned to Utah, purchasing land in Salt Lake City to build their 7,500-square-foot home, completed in eighteen months. Their 2019 move-in coincided with filming their Netflix show, ""Dream Home Makeover."" Ms. McGee designed the home with a blend of open and closed concepts, emphasizing functional, casual living. Her design incorporates unconventional elements like a tumbleweed and ceramic art from Mallorca by Dora Alzamora Good.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"When Shea and Syd McGee sold their Tuscan-style tract house in Orange County, Calif., it started a new chapter for the couple. They reinvested the money into Studio McGee , the multidisciplinary design firm they founded in 2014, and lived out of rental homes across Salt Lake City for the next few years in order to grow the business. They’ve since expanded into e-commerce with the brand McGee & Co ., eventually landing a multiyear partnership with Target for a merchandise line. It wasn’t until 2018 that the McGees began looking for a place where their family could put down roots. After returning to Utah, the state that brought them together during their college days, they noticed a plot of land available to purchase in the Salt Lake City area. The McGees felt inspired to build their home from scratch, just like their brand. The 7,500-square-foot home took a year and a half to complete, but proved to be worth the wait. “It had really pretty views of the mountains out of the windows, and it just seemed like it was the spot for us to at least build a home,” Ms. McGee said of the area. “Doing what I do, I thought, we’ll build this home, I can design it, and then maybe we move on and do it again. But we fell in love with the neighborhood and now I’m like, Oh, I have to really settle into this home.” While she wasn’t expecting the move-in date in 2019 to coincide with the first day of filming for their Netflix reality show, “ Dream Home Makeover ,” the strict deadline forced her to expedite the decorating process so her family wouldn’t have to stay shacked up in her studio upstairs. All stress aside, Ms. McGee said that “it was a very interesting first year in the home.” Since Ms. McGee didn’t want the main level to feel like one huge room, she designed the layout to have a mix of closed rooms and open-concept living to blend flow with division. When people walk through the front door, the first place they enter is the living room, so the designer wanted it to feel casual and relaxed. While it might seem like a place where people should look but not touch, everything in the room is meant to be functional, Ms. McGee said. She enjoys playing games with her daughters, Wren, Ivy and Margot, on a rustic oak side table between a pair of velvet armchairs, all three of which she designed. With more of the tiny tables spread throughout the room, they naturally transition into food stands for guests when Ms. McGee hosts parties. “We don’t have a traditional formal living room, so I like that it could be dressed up, but also comfortable enough that I can have our young family just spread out and make pillow forts on the sofa” she said. “I think that really speaks to my design style in general. I love everything to feel like it is inspiring, but also that you could cozy up and stay for a while.” Ms. McGee has a wandering eye when it comes to sources of inspiration, which she argues can be found anywhere. One day while driving through the Utah desert, she became distracted by a tumbleweed that rolled in front of her car. Mesmerized by its unusual beauty, the designer pulled over and ran out to pluck it from the middle of the road. Since then, the tumbleweed has traveled throughout the house, most recently moving from a pedestal to a shelf in one of the built-in display cabinets. Instead of creating gallery walls with her artwork, she prefers seeing it alongside other objects from her collection. “I love that it’s large and has these interesting branching shapes and textures throughout,” she said. “When I’m styling, I love to incorporate things that aren’t perfect — whether it’s a tumbleweed or a rock you find that’s really inspiring, people shouldn’t be afraid to incorporate that into their little vignettes that they create.” When Ms. McGee was carefully considering her options for a couch, she fancied the idea of a slip-covered sofa that would be comfortable enough for deep sleeping without slipping between the cushions. The designer settled on performance linen for the upholstery in order to spare herself the trouble of wear-and-tear from a house full of busy children. Ms. McGee claims that the material “tricks even most designers” because it looks and drapes like a luxury linen. “I can scrub and clean it, and then it goes back to its original beauty,” she said. A few years ago, Ms. McGee went on a birthday trip to the Spanish island of Mallorca. While she and her husband wandered down the streets of Deià, a coastal village, they came across Gres Gallery . Ms. McGee was intrigued by the ceramic sculptures in the space, and then noticed a woman making hand-thrown stoneware vessels in the back of the showroom. She turned out to be Dora Alzamora Good , a local artist who shares the studio with her mother, the prominent painter and potter Grace Alzamora. After talking to the ceramist for a while, Ms. McGee decided to buy some of her pieces. The vase is stationed on an oak pedestal in a corner of the room where Ms. McGee can admire it from a close distance. “I wanted this really large vase and said a prayer that it would make it back to me because I had to have them ship it to me,” she said. “It arrived in one piece and stays in the corner. Sometimes it’s left alone, and then sometimes I have branches or flowers in it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/05/multimedia/05re-designfinds-mcgee-02-kmph/05re-designfinds-mcgee-02-kmph-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
74,The First Look Inside the Flatiron Building Condo Conversion,Jane Margolies and George Etheredge,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/05/realestate/flatiron-building-condo-conversion.html,2025-11-05,"The Flatiron Building is undergoing an office-to-residential condo conversion, led by the Brodsky Organization and Sorgente Group. A hard-hat tour provided a look at progress, including a 3,900-square-foot, four-bedroom model apartment furnished by Rebecca Robertson. Architectural designer William Sofield developed solutions for the building's 38 unique units, which feature repurposed historic elements and a public cafe. Units range from $11 million to $50 million, with James Lansill of Corcoran Sunshine reporting substantial interest. The expensive conversion, expected to yield over $700 million, targets completion by late 2026 and will include the building's first-time night illumination.",,The New York Times,Public/Private Development,"Of the many office-to-residential conversions happening in Manhattan right now, perhaps none has aroused as much interest as that of the Flatiron Building. For starters, the 22-story tower is one of the most instantly recognizable buildings in the world, prominently located at the intersection of Broadway, Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street, giving would-be residents the chance to live in a landmark in a neighborhood that now bears the building’s name, the Flatiron district. The narrow triangular shape of the building also presents something of a mathematical challenge: How do you create gracious, livable apartments on floors that lack right angles? How, in other words, do you square a triangle? A hard-hat tour of the Flatiron last week provided clues. Workers swarmed the site, smoothing plaster on ceilings and fitting huge slabs of Vermont marble on what will be lavish master baths. But all was calm on the 12th floor, where a 3,900-square-foot, four-bedroom model apartment inside the building’s famous north-facing tip had just been furnished by the interior designer Rebecca Robertson for prospective buyers. Filling the many-windowed prow is a 60-foot-long great room that includes a living area, dining area and open kitchen. A seating nook with a banquette fits into the curved end of the space, its windows looking over Madison Square Park and up Fifth Avenue. Diagonal steel braces, original supports that help keep the skinny structure standing in wind gusts, pierce the ceiling. The supports have been left exposed, as have many structural columns throughout the building, a reminder that the Flatiron, designed by Daniel Burnham and completed in 1902, was one of New York’s early steel-frame skyscrapers. Despite the building’s extravagantly ornamented Beaux-Arts exterior, the model unit has something of a downtown loft vibe. “These apartments are going to be some of the most unique in the city,” said the developer Daniel Brodsky, standing in the great room in stocking feet, having left his shoes at the unit’s front door in deference to the new rugs and floors. His company, the Brodsky Organization, is overseeing the condo conversion with the Sorgente Group, a real estate development firm, on behalf of a group of owners that he joined after disagreements with a previous owner led to back-to-back auctions . But figuring out layouts for the building’s 38 units was not easy for him and the rest of his team. Before Mr. Brodsky came on the scene, the owners, including GFP Real Estate and the Sorgente Group, were reconsidering an earlier plan to upgrade the Flatiron into a high-end office building after its last tenant, Macmillan Publishers, departed in 2019, leaving behind a warren of oddly shaped work spaces. The owners had begun to gut the interior and had determined that the mechanical core that would include elevators and fire stairs should be located in the southern half of the building, running perpendicular to Fifth Avenue. But the core was so large and blocky that it was hard to figure out how apartments might flow around it, let alone how to fill them with normally proportioned rooms. In the end, the architectural designer William Sofield, the founder and principal of Studio Sofield — who Mr. Brodsky hired to design the Flatiron apartments and amenity spaces — hit on the solution. Mr. Sofield proposed elongating and narrowing the core and rotating it so it ran parallel to Broadway. This meant rooms on the western side of the building, along Fifth Avenue, could be more or less rectilinear, and it also made full-floor units possible. Mr. Sofield is bringing back historic details, repurposing artifacts found in the basement and in vaults that extend under the sidewalk on Fifth Avenue. Staircase balustrades yielded spiraling spindles that, after being sandblasted, will be used as legs for powder room basins. Steampunk fittings from the old boilers will decorate the building’s gym. The Flatiron’s new entrance will be on its southwest corner, at East 22nd Street and Fifth Avenue, and a wooden revolving door that was added to the building in its early years will be reinstalled there after being restored by an Indiana craftsman. Hanging over the lobby — once a Western Union office — will be an enormous chandelier that Mr. Sofield designed after falling in love with a streetlamp he spotted in a historic photograph showing part of Madison Square Park. Seating areas off the new lobby will gobble up much of the Flatiron’s ground-floor retail space, but Macmillan’s old lobby, a barrel-vaulted space running from Broadway to Fifth Avenue, will become a cafe open to the public. A bank wanted to lease the retail space in the prow, but James Lansill, who is overseeing sales and marketing of the building for Corcoran Sunshine, said the team is holding out for a “special” tenant. Despite all the efforts with the layouts of the condos — which start at $11 million for a three-bedroom and top out at $50 million for a five-bedroom with a terrace on the 21st floor — the units do have their quirks. In the model unit, the master bedroom is curved on one side. A hall veers diagonally. And while closets are plentiful, one wonders how prospective buyers of the multi-million-dollar apartments might feel about the tiny, zigzagging one in the model unit that ends in a sharp point. Mr. Lansill said that there has been “substantial interest, active negotiations, contracts out and some signed.” About 20 percent of those who have expressed interest are from outside the United States, he added, while some are from the immediate neighborhood. Mr. Brodsky declined to reveal what the renovation is costing, but said that it has been “very expensive.” Selling all units is expected to yield over $700 million. All apartments are expected to be completed by the end of 2026. But well before that — and for the first time — the exterior will be illuminated at night, marking the moment when the 123-year-old Flatiron sheds its office past and enters its condo future.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/05/multimedia/05re-flatiron-condos-03-tzfv/05re-flatiron-condos-03-tzfv-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
75,"A Family Grows Their House, and Grows Into It, Too",Tim McKeough and Kate Sears,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/realestate/new-york-architect-tiny-house.html,2025-11-04,"Dimitri Brand, an architect, and Nelly Mecklenburg bought a 10-acre lot in Hillsdale, N.Y., for $32,000 in 2019, seeking a permanent home. Facing budget constraints, they embarked on self-construction, building incrementally. Their first 100-square-foot structure was a basic platform. By spring 2021, they began building their primary residence: a 475-square-foot basement office and a 450-square-foot living space, largely completed by their 2023 marriage. Following Ms. Mecklenburg's pregnancy, they added an 850-square-foot extension, initially using 200 square feet for an expanded kitchen, with remaining space left unfinished for future needs. The couple kept construction costs to about $325,000 through their DIY approach.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Early in their relationship, Dimitri Brand and Nelly Mecklenburg decided that they wanted to build a house. For years, they had uprooted their lives on a regular basis, moving between New Haven, Conn.; Philadelphia; Washington, D.C.; and Cambridge, England, for school and work. The frequent changes left them craving some place they could create a sense of permanence. “We always talked about building a house,” said Mr. Brand, 36, a founder of the architecture firm Holesum Studio . “Wanting to have some solidity to our relationship and to our life, we started looking for land to buy.” Ms. Mecklenburg, 36, grew up in New York and Mr. Brand was raised in northeastern Connecticut. For their new home, they wanted to be near those locations but “in a beautiful, rural place,” Mr. Brand said. In 2019, they found a 10-acre undeveloped lot that met that description on the outskirts of Hillsdale, N.Y., near the Massachusetts border, and bought it for $32,000. But having the desire to build a house is different than having the budget to do so. With few funds to dedicate to the project, Mr. Brand and Ms. Mecklenburg came up with a couple of solutions. They would do much of the construction work themselves and call in friends to help. But, perhaps more important, they would build only as much space as they needed, and add to their home as life required. The first structure they built, the same year they bought the land, was a 100-square-foot platform with a roof and sliding doors made from translucent corrugated polycarbonate. With no insulation, plumbing or electricity, but equipped with a tiny wood stove, the structure is part camping platform, part rustic cabin, which was enough for the couple to begin visiting the property and seeing how it changed through the seasons. Over the following months, as they got to know their land more intimately, they identified a site for a driveway leading to a future home. They also made plans for bringing in electricity, a well and a septic system. In spring 2021, they began building a house where they could live and work full time. The compact structure included a 475-square-foot walkout basement dug into the hillside, which would serve as Mr. Brand’s office, and a 450-square-foot living space above with a sleeping loft. Mr. Brand used local hemlock for exterior siding and interior wall paneling, floors and built-in cabinetry. When a few oak trees had to be cut down to make way for the driveway and house, Mr. Brand took the opportunity to have them milled into flooring by Hudson Valley Timberworks and Restoration for a future project. For light and warmth, much of the basement is wrapped in twin-wall polycarbonate panels, which are commonly used in greenhouses and can create significant heat on sunny winter days. A wood stove provides additional heat and sits within a double-height niche that rises to the living space, where interior windows can be opened to warm the upstairs as well. The couple installed a small mini-split heat pump, which they rarely use, and tubing for a possible future hydronic radiant heating system under the floors. “We were making sure we had flexibility,” said Ms. Mecklenburg, who works in international development. “It’s about being adaptable.” By the spring of 2023, when they were married, the house was largely complete. But after tackling so much construction themselves, “we tried to agree to a year of no building,” she said. When they put down their tools, they were happy to find that the tiny house they had built was everything they needed — at least for a while. The next spring, Ms. Mecklenburg became pregnant with the couple’s son, who is now nearly 1. Fearing they didn’t have enough space for a child, they began building again. Mr. Brand designed an addition with the aim of creating a framework for all the space they might need, now and in the future. The extension measures 850 square feet, but the family is using just 200 square feet of it at first. Finished with oak flooring and paneling made from their own trees, the space allowed them to expand the kitchen from a small space for cooking basic meals to a full-size kitchen where it will be possible to prepare holiday meals. “Before, it was really a kitchenette, with very little counter space,” Mr. Brand said. “Now, we end up spending most of our time as a family there,” Ms. Mecklenburg said. They are leaving the rest of the addition as raw, unfinished space for now and plan to gradually use more of it as their needs and desires change. They envision wanting a primary suite separate from their child’s room in the future, for instance. So far, by doing so much of the work themselves and relying on free labor provided by friends, the couple have kept construction costs to about $325,000. With a design that’s meant to change over time, Mr. Brand said, “this house has the capacity to be there for the different phases of our lives.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/04/multimedia/04re-small-rawspace-01-tqzj/04re-small-rawspace-01-tqzj-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp
105,Don’t Let Tariffs Ruin Your Renovation. Here Are 5 Tips.,Rachel Wharton,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/realestate/renovation-tips-tariffs.html,2025-11-06,"President Trump’s new tariffs on construction materials, including 25% on imported cabinets/furniture and 50% on aluminum/steel/copper, are increasing renovation costs, causing confusion for homeowners. Industry experts offer tips to minimize impact. Contractor Darryl Seif and Joe Kemph advise against delaying projects, noting costs rarely decrease. Designer Colleen Bennett recommends making early design decisions to lock in prices and place orders quickly. Lauren Tolles and A.J. Altman suggest considering domestic alternatives for materials like cabinetry, stone, and roofing. Greg Stanton highlights architectural salvage for used items. For future renovations, dedicated savings and building design flexibility are recommended.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"President Trump’s new tariffs on construction materials and building supplies affect almost every element of home renovations, from gypsum and plywood to appliances, roofing, furniture, lighting, tiles and cabinetry. As of now, they include 25 percent levies on imported cabinets, vanities and upholstered furniture, as well as 50 percent fees on aluminum, steel and copper parts. But that could easily change. (While the Supreme Court is in the process of deciding whether the president has the right to impose broad tariffs on foreign countries, it is not weighing in on these item-based tariffs.) For homeowners planning a full renovation or even making basic upgrades, the confusion is paralyzing, and could mean paying more for everything. But there are ways to avoid or at least minimize the effect of the tariffs. We asked industry experts — including architects, designers, contractors and suppliers — for tips on how to do it. It might be tempting to delay a project in the hope that tariffs disappear or decrease, said Darryl Seif, who is a contractor and the founder of the Gramercy Group, a design and construction firm based in Los Angeles. But it’s unlikely to work, he said. “I’ll tell you,” Mr. Seif said, “costs rarely go down.” Mr. Seif has watched prices for construction projects increase every year for the past decade, especially after the pandemic. Six years ago, his company could build a pool and spa for around $70,000. “Now,” he said, “I can’t do it for under $180,000.” He also expects U.S. suppliers to raise prices as demand for their products outstrips supply, or as other economic consequences of the tariffs emerge. Joe Kemph, the vice president of supply chain at Power Home Remodeling, which manages exterior renovations in 25 locations across the country, agreed with Mr. Seif: Don’t wait. “If you’re able to finance whatever necessary project you’re doing in your home, this is the best time to do it,” he said. In the past, you might have been able to wait to decide the exact shade of metal you want for your doorknobs, said Colleen Bennett, the lead designer and founder of CBB Design Firm in Morganton, N.C. Because costs on nearly everything can rise so quickly, Ms. Bennett is urging her clients to make even the smallest design decisions as early as possible, so they can place orders and make deposits to help set prices. This applies no matter where the product is made, she said. “Whether you are working with a designer or a handyman, get your selections done,” said Ms. Bennett, who uses 3-D renderings to help clients make those choices earlier in the process. “Get it pre-priced, get your budget, and understand that.” “Buy it now, that’s what I would say,” Ms. Bennett said. “Don’t buy as you go, because you’ll pay triple.” Most professionals are encouraging people to purchase as many materials and supplies as they can once they have a plan. “Tile, slab, wallpaper, plumbing, lighting, door knobs — all of that should be jumped on as quickly as possible,” in order to avoid increasing costs and tariff confusion, Mr. Seif said. He even recommends buying appliances like air-conditioners, water heaters, HVAC systems, refrigerators, stoves and washing machines, as long as you have room to store them. “That’s an unusual thing to buy in advance,” he said. “Usually they go in last.” Designers, architects, builders and contractors are now largely responsible for guiding clients through the implications of Mr. Trump’s import taxes. The job is “a lot of just trying to figure out how to purchase,” Ms. Bennett said. “It’s constantly watching where your manufacturers are from, when to order, when not to order.” Many of these decisions affect not just budget, but design, said Lauren Tolles, the founder of Maison Birmingham, a company in Michigan that designs custom cabinetry for kitchens and baths. She predicts that the tariffs “will force us to look more domestically for cabinetry, stone, things like that.” Many American-made options are “lovely,” Ms. Tolles said, but can have a different look and feel than what people are used to. One example is the melamine used as a finish on sleek cabinetry, which is mostly made in Europe, Canada and Asia. With tariffs, she said, we may return to building with real wood. A.J. Altman, the founder of Hover, an online platform for 3-D modeling of construction projects, said that contractors are already thinking through substitutions, like using American-made asphalt for roofing instead of imported metal shingles, or using domestic concrete, stone and brick instead of lumber Over 80 percent lumber imported into the United States is from Canada, according to the National Association of Home Builders . If you’re going it alone, seek advice from an experienced friend, if possible, and get a sense of the costs and breadth of options by going to stores and doing the research. You might also consider buying some materials used, said Greg Stanton, who helps run Green Circle Auctions, a Connecticut-based architectural salvage company that hosts online auctions from high-end homes. These kinds of salvage companies resell hardwood flooring, fireplace mantels, cabinetry, plumbing and other items that would cost you more if imported. If your renovation is still a few years out, Ms. Tolles recommends setting up a separate savings account for the project. “That’s totally what I would do myself, if I was saving up for a renovation,” she said. While you save, she said, avoid doing smaller, cheaper “refreshes” unless they’re really critical, so that you have more money to work with when it’s time to truly renovate. “Do you want to have to do this all over again when it is even more expensive?” she said. Ms. Tolles also recommends spending a little more to build flexibility into your home now, to avoid future alterations. Consider how you or your children will age over the next decade, or whether family members may come to live with you later in life. When she was designing an office on the ground floor of her own house, for example, Ms. Tolles made sure it could be converted into an en suite bedroom.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/06/multimedia/06re-TARIFFS-RENOVATIONS-01-pqct/06re-TARIFFS-RENOVATIONS-01-pqct-facebookJumbo.jpg

112,First-Time Home Buyers Are Older Than Ever,Julia Carpenter,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/06/realestate/first-time-home-buyers.html,2025-11-07,"The median age of first-time home buyers reached an all-time high of 40 in 2025, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors (N.A.R.). This marks a steep climb from 28 in 1991, 33 in 2020, and 38 in 2024. Younger Americans struggle to save down payments due to student loans, rising living costs, and high rents, compounded by a lack of affordable housing inventory. As a result, the share of first-time buyers in the U.S. market has fallen to 21 percent, half of 2007 levels. Repeat buyers with accrued equity and lower pre-pandemic mortgage rates are more competitive, making larger down payments and all-cash offers, edging out first-time buyers.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"The path to homeownership continues to get longer, with the median age of first-time home buyers hitting an all-time high of 40 in 2025, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors. “It’s kind of a shocking number,” said Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist and vice president of research at N.A.R. “And it’s really been in recent years that we’ve seen this steep climb.” In 1991, the typical first-time buyer was able to purchase a home by the time they were 28 years old. That number gradually climbed to 33 in 2020, then shot up to 36 in 2022 and 38 in 2024. There are clear reasons behind the trend. Younger Americans are struggling to save for a down payment as they stretch their paychecks to cover student loans , a rising cost of living and, most critically, high rents , which make saving money harder. And even if they have saved diligently, a persistent lack of affordable housing inventory has left them shut out of the market. As a result, according to N.A.R., the share of first-time home buyers in the U.S. market has fallen to a meager 21 percent — about half of what it was in 2007, just before the housing crash. “The implications for the housing market are staggering,” according to Ms. Lautz. “Today’s first-time buyers are building less housing wealth and will likely have fewer moves over a lifetime as a result.” Meanwhile, people who already own homes are accruing huge amounts of equity, thanks to soaring values and low prepandemic mortgage rates. That allows them to make larger down payments and all-cash offers when they want to buy something new. First-time buyers, especially younger ones, can’t compete. The question is: Will they ever be able to? The median age of first-time buyers has reached a historic high as they are edged out of the market by repeat buyers, according to a new report from the National Association of Realtors. Median age of ... YEAR Repeat Buyers First-time buyers 1991 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 42 55 55 56 59 58 61 62 28 33 33 33 36 35 38 40 Median age of ...

154,A Yacht for Your Yacht,Ronda Kaysen and Scott McIntyre,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/realestate/american-superyacht-buyers.html,2025-11-10,"Superyacht owners increasingly acquire ""shadow yachts"" for toys or ""chase boats."" The Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, concluding November 2, displayed 1,300 vessels, including over 200 superyachts (>=24 meters). Farouk Nefzi of Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards stated yachts are ""100 percent emotion."" Today's superyacht buyers are younger, richer Americans, driven by pandemic business booms, a strong stock market, and tax cuts. Americans own 23% of global superyachts over 40 meters. Sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up year-over-year; sales of 80-meter+ boats nearly doubled in 2024. The top 0.1% of American households saw wealth grow 90% from Q4 2017 to Q2 2025. Annual maintenance costs approximate 10% of a yacht's value.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room. But still, there are “a few things that we don’t have here,” Mr. Staluppi said, like a private bathroom inside his office. So, he’ll probably buy a bigger boat.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/08/multimedia/08re-superyachts-lkwh/08re-superyachts-lkwh-facebookJumbo.jpg

Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room.

SuperYacht Times reports sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up, with sales over 80 meters almost doubling from 2023 to 2024. Americans own 23% of the global superyacht fleet over 40 meters. Andrew Currie's ""Hampshire"" was the most expensive offering at 85 million euros. John Staluppi purchased ""Casino Royale"" for 120 million euros, viewing a yacht as ""a home away from home."" Superyachts are depreciating, high-maintenance assets.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data.

Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room.

Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts.

Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room. But still, there are “a few things that we don’t have here,” Mr. Staluppi said, like a private bathroom inside his office.

While overall yacht sales are down, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up, with boats over 80 meters nearly doubling sales in 2024, according to SuperYacht Times. Americans, now younger and richer, are increasingly buying superyachts, owning 23% of the global fleet over 40 meters, linked to wealth growth since 2017. Examples include Andrew Currie's Hampshire (85M euros) and John Staluppi's Casino Royale (120M euros). Annual maintenance costs approximately 10% of a boat's value.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court.

A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025.

These ""floating villas"" are considered ""100 percent emotion"" by Farouk Nefzi of Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards. Younger, wealthier American buyers, enriched by the pandemic business boom, stock market, and tax cuts, now lead the market. According to SuperYacht Times, Americans own 23% of the global fleet over 40 meters, and sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are increasing. The 85 million euro Hampshire was the most expensive offering. These assets are costly, with annual maintenance reaching 10% of their value, and some buyers seek ""Armageddon"" yachts for autonomous living.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said.

John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room. But still, there are “a few things that we don’t have here,” Mr. Staluppi said, like a private bathroom inside his office.

173,A Famous Narrow House in the West Village Listed for $4.195 Million,Vivian Marino,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/realestate/narrowest-townhouse-nyc-west-village-listing.html,2025-11-03,"The Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show concluded, displaying 1,300 vessels, including over 200 superyachts. The market for superyachts 40 meters and larger is growing, with sales of vessels over 80 meters nearly doubling in 2024 and projected to hold steady in 2025. American buyers, whose wealth increased significantly from 2017 to 2025, now account for 23% of the global superyacht fleet over 40 meters. They are younger and richer, purchasing vessels like the 85 million euro ""Hampshire"" or ""Casino Royale"" for 120 million euros. Some are ""Armageddon buyers"" seeking autonomous vessels. Superyachts are depreciating assets with high maintenance.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen .

Owners often utilize ""shadow yachts"" for carrying toys like jet skis and helicopters, or ""chase boats"" for shorter trips. Superyacht sales, particularly for vessels over 40 meters, are on the rise, with sales of boats over 80 meters almost doubling in 2024. American buyers, now younger and wealthier due to recent economic factors, constitute 23% of the global superyacht fleet over 40 meters. The most expensive offering was Hampshire at €85 million (nearly $100 million). These vessels, though considered unnecessary and depreciating assets with high maintenance, offer extensive amenities, with some designed for autonomous living.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room. But still, there are “a few things that we don’t have here,” Mr. Staluppi said, like a private bathroom inside his office. So, he’ll probably buy a bigger boat.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/08/multimedia/08re-superyachts-lkwh/08re-superyachts-lkwh-facebookJumbo.jpg

Farouk Nefzi of Feadship noted owners often have multiple vessels, including ""shadow yachts"" for toys. American buyers are increasingly younger and wealthier, accounting for 23% of the global superyacht fleet over 40 meters. This trend is linked to a pandemic business boom, stock market performance, and deep tax cuts. While overall yacht sales are down, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up, with sales over 80 meters nearly doubling in 2024. The 66.25-meter Hampshire, priced at 85 million euros, was the most expensive. Owners like John Staluppi view yachts as luxury homes, despite high costs.",,The New York Times,Public/Private Development,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18.

207,A Yacht for Your Yacht,Sally McGrane and Vesa Laitinen,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/realestate/helsinki-finland-bunkers-bomb-shelters.html,2025-11-10,"The Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, ending Nov. 2, showcased 1,300 vessels, including over 200 superyachts (24m+), to over 100,000 visitors. Superyacht sales, particularly vessels 40 meters and larger, are increasing, with 80m+ sales almost doubling in 2024 and projected to hold steady in 2025, contrasting with a decline in overall yacht sales. American buyers, now younger, wealthier due to pandemic business booms, a strong stock market, and tax cuts, account for 23% of global superyacht owners and are driving market growth. Notable examples include Andrew Currie’s 85 million euro Hampshire and John Staluppi’s 120 million euro Casino Royale, featuring amenities like helipads and spas.",,The New York Times,Public/Private Development,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room.

226,New York Lacked an Affordable Housing Portal. So These Teenagers Made One.,Dan Levin,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/realestate/affordable-housing-rent-stabilized-website.html,2025-11-14,"High school seniors Beckett Zahedi and Derrick Webster Jr., both 17, launched ""Realer Estate,"" a website to help New Yorkers find affordable and rent-stabilized apartments. Inspired by personal struggles to find housing, Beckett taught himself to code and, with Derrick, developed the platform. The site combines public data with real estate listings, identifying below-market and rent-stabilized units, a tool New York City previously lacked. ""Realer Estate"" has attracted over 27,000 visitors and earned praise from City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. An entrepreneurship start-up, Audos, has agreed to invest up to $25,000. The project aims to streamline the difficult search for affordable housing in New York, where median rent is about $4,000.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"When Beckett Zahedi was in the fifth grade, he’d accompany his recently divorced father and younger sister on a grueling New York City ritual: the hunt for an affordable apartment. On weekends, they’d trudge through fruitless viewings in Brooklyn, jostling through crowds and sidestepping cockroaches until the elder Zahedi finally found a place to rent. “I wanted to make sure that they felt comfortable in the place, and it’s hard to find something, so he had this experience over and over of being rejected,” Caveh Zahedi said of his son. As he got older, Beckett leaned into his entrepreneurial spirit and tech savvy, designing a website where he could sell toys, and hawking T-shirts online. But he never forgot how trying those apartment hunts had been, both emotionally and financially. So last year, as his economics class at the Brooklyn Friends school studied the national housing crisis, he and a classmate hatched an idea for an online housing platform that could help people find homes they could afford. First, he taught himself to code. “I basically spent the first two months of summer in my room, learning from YouTube and A.I.,” said Beckett, 17. “Those are my teachers.” In July, after countless bleary-eyed hours on bedroom computers, he and Derrick Webster Jr., his classmate, launched Realer Estate , a website that combines public data with real estate listings, allowing users to search for below-market and rent-stabilized apartments — something the grown-ups who run New York City have never managed to do. “This is basically the tool that my family needed,” said Beckett, a lanky high school senior with a mop of wavy hair and perhaps the quintessential marker of modern youthful ambition, a LinkedIn profile . “We’d just see, like, one good apartment a month that we can afford. I thought it might be faster, instead of wasting more years, to just create an algorithm that would do that for me.” The site has already attracted more than 27,000 visitors, along with adoration from local officials, including Adrienne Adams, the New York City Council speaker. During a Council meeting in October, Ms. Adams said she was “so impressed with Beckett and his commitment to helping fellow New Yorkers secure affordable housing.” At first, Beckett and Derrick aimed to create a nationwide platform, manually listing properties as far afield as Idaho and Texas. “It was way too much for us to handle,” Beckett said on a recent evening, sitting beside his mother, Amanda Field, in their Brooklyn apartment, as his sister’s loft bed loomed over the dining table. So they decided to focus on New York. “They’re children of the pandemic,” said Ms. Field, who watched Beckett and his friends develop their digital skills during Covid lockdowns and remote schooling. “They were living their real lives in the digital world.” The curious may wonder why two kids who aren’t old enough to vote would even need to create such a platform — as opposed to, say, New York’s vast bureaucracy. A tenant can officially find out if their unit is rent-stabilized by submitting a request to New York State Homes and Community Renewal. But there is no public database of rent-stabilized apartments in the city, only a government website with PDF lists of buildings containing at least one such unit. And those lists may be inaccurate or outdated. The city’s affordable-housing lottery, NYC Housing Connect , typically receives around 500 applications for each unit listed, according to the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Competition is fierce and waits can take years. “There needs to be a more uniform, streamlined way for people to be to be able to find affordable apartments,” said Leah Goodridge, a member of the City Planning Commission. “New Yorkers suffer for it.” At a time when the median rent in the city is about $4,000 , finding one of the roughly one million rent-stabilized apartments often comes down to luck, pluck and patience. Amateur sleuths will pore over obituaries for clues; hunters will bribe landlords with “key money” to obtain a coveted lease. Online, the quest has fueled a cottage industry of tips and advice . “If you’re explicitly looking for a rent-stabilized apartment, then you have to be a big-time hustler,” said Matthew Murphy, executive director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. Beckett and Derrick are trying to make the search easier. While Beckett built the platform over the summer, Derrick, also 17, worked on creating an email system for users. Collaboration was “really, really important,” Derrick said. “Sometimes my new update to the project would crash something that he would make, and he would have to call me at midnight, saying, ‘Hey you messed up something.’” Beckett quickly discovered that building the site was “much harder problem-solving than in my math homework.” “It was just failing, getting every single line wrong until it all fell into place,” he said. His algorithm scans active sales and rental listings, cross-referenced with all rent-stabilized building addresses, and calculates affordability by comparing against similar properties based on categories including bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities and price per square foot. Users can search specifically for rent-stabilized units, or for apartments that the site calculates as affordable. Listings determined to be at least 15 percent below market are saved as “undervalued” on the platform, which links to StreetEasy. “It’s not a perfect estimate, but it helps renters get a better sense of how good of a deal an apartment is,” Beckett said. One local agent, Tiger Liu of Compass, was impressed enough to give the teens $1,000 to advertise, and said his first client from the site recently went into contract on an apartment. “It’s very helpful to people because the current resource is just not enough,” he said. Another backer is Audos, an entrepreneurship start-up, which agreed to invest up to $25,000 in the project — with some oversight. “We’re not handing a 16-year-old kid $25,000 and letting him go crazy,” said Andres Zubillaga, an Audos founder. The company has worked with businesses focused on moving and interior decorating, but “in terms of actually helping you with the apartment search, this is the first we’ve seen,” Mr. Zubillaga said. While the website is largely automated, running it still consumes much of Beckett and Derrick’s time. “Right after school, you make sure you get all your homework done, and then it’s your whole entire night,” Derrick said. Indeed, Realer Estate is a work in progress. Some neighborhoods have few listings, and the affordability scores are not for all budgets. The wrinkles are being ironed out between college applications, schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Beckett has been attending community board meetings to beef up on housing issues, and chose to forgo playing on his school basketball team this year. (“I’m not super good,” he admitted.) But like a lot of kids his age, what he is good at is the internet. Plenty of adults have tried to tackle New York’s affordable-housing problem with limited success, so why not give two high school students a chance? After all, Derrick noted, the housing lottery email notification feature that the City Council will require is similar to the alert system he already built for Realer Estate. “What we want to do is see how we can be more involved with the city, learn from them, take our experience and give back,” Derrick said. “There’s a lot more people we can help.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/14/multimedia/14re-TEENAGER-HOUSING-PLATFORM1-gwmj/14re-TEENAGER-HOUSING-PLATFORM1-gwmj-facebookJumbo.jpg

229,Brooklyn Investor Who Stole Homes Faces Years Behind Bars,Rukmini Callimachi,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/realestate/sanford-solny-home-deeds-sentencing.html,2025-11-13,"Brooklyn real estate investor Sanford Solny was sentenced to up to seven years in prison on Wednesday by Justice Danny Chun. Solny, 68, was convicted in June of 17 counts, including scheme to defraud and grand larceny, for convincing vulnerable homeowners to sign away deeds to 11 Brooklyn properties. The court nullified the deeds, potentially allowing victims to reclaim homes, but declined financial restitution for over $500,000 in collected rent. Solny, disbarred after fraud accusations, had previously pleaded guilty to similar offenses in Queens in 2018 and continued his fraud. Victims, often Black or Latino immigrants, were typically behind on mortgage payments.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Sanford Solny built a fortune by convincing vulnerable homeowners to sign away the deeds to their homes. On Wednesday, the Brooklyn real estate investor was sentenced to up to seven years in prison, closing a long and tangled case that left families in financial ruin. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun also ordered that the deeds to the 11 homes taken by Mr. Solny be nullified — a ruling that could allow some homeowners to reclaim their houses. But Judge Chun declined to grant financial restitution to the victims, including any portion of the hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent that Mr. Solny collected after evicting homeowners and installing his own tenants. The 68-year-old Solny, a former lawyer from Midwood, Brooklyn, who was disbarred following accusations of fraud, was convicted in June of a total of 17 counts , including criminal possession of stolen property, scheme to defraud and grand larceny in connection with the theft of the 11 properties in Brooklyn. His trial in Brooklyn came on the heels of a similar trial in Queens, where in 2018, he pleaded guilty to stealing several other homes and was later sentenced to five years of probation. At least one of the properties in Brooklyn was stolen after his sentencing in Queens — indicating that he continued to defraud people even after being convicted of the same crime in a different borough. “For more than 13 years, my family and I have endured unimaginable hardship in our fight to reclaim the deed to our homes,” said Clotilde Wendpagnangde Sawadogo, an immigrant from Burkina Faso, in a statement that was read to the court. “What should have been a straightforward matter of property rights became a prolonged and devastating ordeal — one that has inflicted deep emotional, physical and psychological harm on every member of our family.” The victims, nearly all of whom are Black or Latino and many of whom are recent immigrants, said that they were referred to Mr. Solny at their lowest point — behind on mortgage payments, facing foreclosure and desperate for help. He offered what seemed like a lifeline: a so-called short sale, promising to negotiate with banks to accept less than the amount owed, even providing the homeowner a small payment and the relief of having their debt erased. In reality, the deed was transferred to Mr. Solny or one of his companies, while the mortgage — and the damage to the homeowner’s credit — remained in the homeowner’s name. In case after case, prosecutors say Mr. Solny collected rent — more than $500,000 in total — even as the debt and the property taxes went unpaid. “My new home meant everything to me,” wrote Janet Bruce in a statement read before the court on Wednesday, explaining how she immigrated from Guyana in 1999 and bought her three-bedroom home in Flatbush in 2006 after more than half a decade of work as a home health aide. “I bought new kitchen cabinets, got electrical and plumbing work done and purchased all new furniture. My neighbors respected me because my home was the neatest one on the block.” After her husband suffered a stroke and lost his job in 2013, she fell behind on payments and, like others, found herself in Mr. Solny’s office. “Because of Sanford Solny, I lost my home. I lost all my furniture and I lost all the work that I put into my home,” she said, describing the humiliation she felt as her belongings were placed on the curb after she lost her deed in 2014. After Ms. Bruce’s departure, Mr. Solny installed tenants and collected an estimated $270,000 in rent, she said, even as the mortgage and property taxes remained in her name — wrecking her credit and, she said, her chance to rebuild. Heavy security awaited both the supporters of the victims and of Mr. Solny at the Brooklyn courthouse on Wednesday. Before being allowed into the building, visitors passed through metal detectors, and the several dozen supporters of Mr. Solny from his Orthodox Jewish community placed their hats on the belt for security screening. On the second floor, where the courtroom was located, at least 21 court police officers were deployed. A tense standoff ensued because more supporters of Mr. Solny were initially allowed into the hallway than supporters of the victims, and a security official with a bullhorn screamed at the crowd to move back. Mr. Solny, who was jailed in September after a probation hearing in Queens, was brought in by the court’s security staff through a side door wearing a suit and a tie. A woman seated behind him next to his family began sobbing, loud enough that she was ordered more than once to be quiet. James Kousouros, Mr. Solny’s lawyer, disputed the portrayal of his client as a predator. “This is just not a situation in which hapless victims had their deeds stolen from them under their noses — it just isn’t,” said Mr. Kousouros, arguing that many of the homeowners were months behind on their mortgage payments. “The purported victims in this case not only sold their deed on paper, in the open, and received money after draining the properties for every nickel they could after not paying mortgages for years.” When he was allowed to speak, Mr. Solny thanked his family, his friends and the rabbis who had come to support him. He described the anguish of having been jailed in September on the eve of Yom Kippur — a turn of events that he said had been “shocking” to him — and how he was taken to Rikers Island without the requisite materials to pray and without access to kosher food. He never addressed the victims. “He didn’t even say he was sorry,” said Ms. Sawadogo outside the courthouse, where she said that she remained confused about what would happen next: Will she get her house back?",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12re-solny-sentencing-01-phjv/12re-solny-sentencing-01-phjv-facebookJumbo.jpg

Fewer than 2% of listings in popular East Coast markets meet this price point. However, 13 of the 100 largest U.S. metro areas offer over a third of available units for under $1,000, with Wichita, Kan., and McAllen, Texas, exceeding 50%. Living with roommates significantly increases affordability, with median single-room rents under $1,000 in 86 metros and shared single-family homes under $1,000 per person in 36 metros.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"You might think that renting an apartment for less than $1,000 per month in 2025 is unrealistic. But new research from Zillow reveals that it’s actually fairly common in parts of the South and Midwest. According to researchers , rent increases are outpacing growth in household income since 2001, leaving more Americans to spend over 30 percent of their income on housing — the generally accepted threshold of affordability . In popular East Coast markets like Boston, Miami and Washington, D.C., fewer than 2 percent of apartment listings rent for less than $1,000. But in 13 of the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, more than a third of available apartment units can be rented for $1,000 a month or less. In Wichita, Kan., and McAllen, Texas, it’s more than half. In Little Rock, Ark., Toledo, Ohio, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Okla., it’s not quite half. Apartment seekers have many more opportunities to snag that elusive $1,000 monthly rent if they live with roommates: Zillow found that the median monthly rent for a single room was less than $1,000 in 86 of the 100 U.S. metros examined. Even renting an entire house becomes more feasible when sharing it. In 36 of the 100 largest metros areas, two roommates could rent a median-price single-family home for less than $1,000 apiece. In Toledo, Wichita, Little Rock, and Dayton, Ohio, the median rent for a single-family home is less than $1,500 a month.

233,"Bars, Restaurants and Buildings Take Karaoke Rooms to the Next Level",Alyson Krueger,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/realestate/karaoke-rooms-expensive-new-york.html,2025-11-11,"High-end karaoke spaces are emerging across New York and New Jersey, transforming bars, restaurants, apartment buildings, and private homes. Beatbox in West Village offers plush suites for up to 70, featuring professional microphones, AI-powered games, and vocal filters. Simon Kim’s Coqodaq restaurant includes a David Rockwell-designed room with Swarovski crystals. Residential buildings like 1289 Lexington feature $300,000 soundproof rooms with green screens, while RiverHouse 11 provides musical instruments. Private homeowners, such as Darren and Rilke McNeill, are also integrating high-tech karaoke setups, indicating a trend towards sophisticated, social singing experiences.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"Beatbox, a dimly-lit karaoke bar in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan, is outfitted with plush-velvet poofs and decorated with vintage vinyls and large photographs of concerts by artists like Lil Uzi Vert and Chappell Roan. There are three private karaoke suites, one of which can fit 70 people. Performers stand on a stage with a wall made up of LED lights behind them, the lyrics of their selected song displayed on a 65-inch TV, belting into professional-grade microphones. In October, Chelsea Lipscomb-LeSane, 31, a creative producer who lives in Fairfield County, Conn., attended an album release party at the venue, which opened to the public on Nov. 1. She knew right away that it was no dive bar karaoke experience. “It feels like a mix between your coolest friend’s living room and a high-end recording studio,” she said. Beatbox is one of many high-end karaoke spaces opening in New York and New Jersey restaurants, apartment buildings and even private homes. These spaces incorporate sophisticated sound systems and proprietary software — and often are fitted with lounge areas suited for a rock star. The owners of Beatbox, Sara Goodison and Lannie Rosenfield Rydell, who met at Stanford University’s business school, spent six months renovating the space, which used to be a Black Tap burger restaurant (They said they found five milkshake machines during the build out.) Singers can opt to freestyle songs or play one of two games built specifically for Beatbox that use artificial intelligence. One awards points for hitting the right notes — “It is like Guitar Hero,” said Ms. Goodison — while the other scores you based on how well you know the lyrics of the songs. Performers can also use karaoke filters and auto-tune to make their singing higher or add vibrato. “It’s like an Instagram filter for your voice,” said Ms. Rosenfield Rydell. Ms. Goodison wanted to get people off their phones and into social spaces. “We really looked at leveraging that technology, which is keeping people isolated and at home and alone,” she said. “If we are going to create a place that people are motivated to come to and spend time, it has to be this high tech experience.” But Beatbox is not the only karaoke bar in town. When Simon Kim opened Coqodaq, a fried chicken restaurant in New York City, he knew he wanted to have a karaoke room. “I am Korean, and in Korea karaoke is a huge thing,” he said. But understanding that social media had allowed everyone to make content from their couch, he knew he had to create a compelling space. So he tapped David Rockwell, the architect and designer behind the restaurant, to build the “sickest karaoke room,” said Mr. Kim. Mr. Rockwell, who said this was his first time tackling a karaoke room, filled the 450-square-foot space with a large stage, embellished with 1,200 meters of Swarovski crystals. The side walls of the stage are made of a dark cork suited for sound proofing, and there are movable banquettes to fit different party sizes. The room was first plotted out as a 3-D model and took three months to build. Mr. Kim said the cost was on the level of a luxury car. Even residential buildings are getting in on the singing action. At 1289 Lexington, an apartment building that opened two years ago on the Upper East Side, there is a $300,000 karaoke room that has heavy metal doors for sound proofing; 16 speakers; acoustically absorptive materials and a green screen for making music videos. The idea was to create a space where teenagers could get off their phones, said Jill Bernard, the building’s director of sales. “Play rooms are standard, and they are beautiful, but what happens when you are 10 and 12 and want an amenity that connects people and makes them smile,” she said. (Teens are still on their phones in the room. But at least they are making videos together.) In RiverHouse 11, a high rise in Weehawken, N.J., residents have access to a karaoke facility that comes with four Fender Stratocaster guitars, a Yamaha piano keyboard and four Marshall amps. Then there is the private home variety. When they moved into a new house in Warwick, N.Y., in 2023, Darren McNeill, 38, who works in automotive sales and operations, and his wife, Rilke, 43, a physical therapist, turned their basement into a high-tech karaoke room and home theater. “We wanted a place where we could go down and escape from things,” Mr. McNeill said. They use an iPad to cast music videos onto a large-screen TV. It is connected to two speakers, optimally placed for the best acoustics. They sing along to the videos with a karaoke machine they bought on Amazon for a few hundred dollars; it came with a 12-inch woofer, two microphones and party lights. But just like in the commercial spaces, their karaoke room is meant for community. Mr. McNeill said friends now invite themselves over to jam out. “We are either legendary or notorious for it, depending on who you ask,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/11/multimedia/11re-karaoke-rooms-03-fqhg/11re-karaoke-rooms-03-fqhg-facebookJumbo.jpg
234,French Chateau Moves In Next to English Tudors,Tim McKeough,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/realestate/birmingham-alabama-designers-french-chateau.html,2025-11-11,"Kevin and Leigh Misso, owners of River Brook design and construction, built a 6,500-square-foot house in Homewood, Ala. Inspired by a 19th-century French chateau exterior and a present-day Parisian apartment interior, the two-story home sits on a street with diverse architectural styles. The couple purchased the lot for $450,000 in March 2023 after a tree damaged the previous home, which they then demolished. Motivated by their growing family's need for a larger house and yard, the Missos designed a unique residence featuring limestone blocks, a turret, and interiors blending antiques with contemporary elements. Construction cost approximately $4 million, and the family moved in by April. The house now serves as a loved home reflecting their travels.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"When Kevin and Leigh Misso began designing their new house in Homewood, Ala., a Birmingham suburb, they weren’t shy about creating exactly the kind of structure they loved most. “We designed the house after a 19th-century French chateau,” said Ms. Misso, 38. “We love traveling in Europe and acquiring antiques,” she said, especially when roaming throughout France. Never mind that the home would be on a street lined with tightly clustered houses built in the 20th century, ranging from homes with neoclassical columns to low-slung bungalows. The area’s architectural hodgepodge seemed to give the couple license to play. “There are English Tudors and some homes with Spanish influence,” Ms. Misso said. “We thought it would be interesting to incorporate some French architecture on our street.” The couple were well positioned to build whatever they wanted. Together, they are the owners of River Brook , a design and construction company that takes the initial sketch to a move-in-ready home. Ms. Misso is the lead designer and Mr. Misso is the director of construction. The Missos previously lived one street over from their current location. But as they had more children — they now have three, aged 3 to 7 — and their youngsters grew, they began to think that it would be nice to have a larger house and a larger yard. “It was about the kids just being able to run and play, and having a yard big enough where all the neighborhood kids could come and play flag football,” said Mr. Misso, 42. In 2023, a massive tree fell on the house behind their former home and caused serious damage, collapsing the roof and compromising a foundation wall. Aware that their octogenarian neighbors had already thought about moving elsewhere, the Missos struck a deal to buy the lot with plans to tear the structure down and replace it. They closed that March for $450,000 and got to work. When designing the new house, Ms. Misso said, “I wanted it to feel like it had been there for 200 years.” The resulting two-story, 6,500-square-foot house is finished with a buff mortar wash and limestone blocks that frame the windows, doorways and outside corners. At the front, one side of the house has an outdoor room within an arcade of arched openings. Ms. Misso wanted a place where she could watch her children play, but an ordinary wood-framed porch wouldn’t fit the character of the house. “Front porches can feel really farmhouse,” she said. Masonry offered the solidity and grandeur she desired. On the other side of the house, she added a turret, which contains a sitting area for the primary suite on the ground floor and a play area for the children above. Inside, the conical ceiling is painted with red and white stripes. “We painted the ceiling of the turret to look like a circus tent,” Ms. Misso said. Indeed, throughout the interiors, she deliberately mixed fine antiques, many of which the couple purchased at Paris flea markets, with contemporary furniture, lighting and art, while adding a few whimsical touches. Although the exterior was inspired by French chateaus, she wanted the interior to feel more like a present-day Parisian apartment, she said, “where you walk in and there’s all this trim, casework and classic architectural detailing, but then you see this juxtaposition with modern art and modern furnishings.” In the foyer, a contemporary chandelier of draped yarn from the Mexican company CoLores Decor hangs above a 19th-century Italian bust on a fluted pedestal. In the living room, an 18th-century tapestry, restored by an artisan in Paris, adorns a traditionally paneled wall above a hefty new rose marble coffee table from Four Hands. In the kitchen, reclaimed 150-year-old wood beams, an antiqued mirror and a crystal chandelier give the appearance of age, but a bright blue free-form wall sculpture by Montana Moore adds a contemporary twist. Even the connected screened porch has a playfully high-contrast look. Equipped with black and white striped curtains, the porch’s wood ceiling and valance are painted in coordinating stripes to look as if the space has been draped completely in fabric. By the time the house was ready for the family to move into in April, construction had cost roughly $4 million. Now, the Missos have a house they love, where the children can play indoors or out, and where the parents continually encounter reminders of the places they’ve visited, and the artists and antiques dealers they’ve met along the way. “I was sitting in the living room the other day just looking at that tapestry, and thinking about all of the rooms that thing has been in and what it has probably seen,” Ms. Misso said. “We look around and love seeing things that have a history and a story behind them,” she added. “We’re just so thankful that we get to call this home.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/10/multimedia/00re-location-birmingham-wzcf/00re-location-birmingham-wzcf-facebookJumbo.jpg
235,A Yacht for Your Yacht,Ronda Kaysen and Scott McIntyre,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/realestate/american-superyacht-buyers.html,2025-11-10,"The Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, which ended Nov. 2, featured over 200 superyachts among 1,300 vessels. Owners are increasingly buying multiple boats, including shadow yachts for amenities. The 85 million euro Hampshire was the most expensive offering. Today's superyacht buyers are younger, richer, and predominantly American, with wealth growth attributed to pandemic business booms, stock market performance, and tax cuts. Americans own 23% of the global superyacht fleet over 40 meters. Sales of larger superyachts are up, despite overall yacht sales declining. Shipyards like Amels report Americans constitute 85% of their superyacht commissions. Annual maintenance costs are about 10% of a boat's value.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room. But still, there are “a few things that we don’t have here,” Mr. Staluppi said, like a private bathroom inside his office. So, he’ll probably buy a bigger boat.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/08/multimedia/08re-superyachts-lkwh/08re-superyachts-lkwh-facebookJumbo.jpg

237,There’s a Real Estate Agent on My Condo Board. Isn’t That a Bad Idea?,Jill Terreri Ramos,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/realestate/condo-boards-conflict-of-interest.html,2025-11-08,"An Upper West Side condominium board member, a real estate broker, sells and leases units in the building, including those bought below market, using privileged resident information. This raises concerns about ethical and legal responsibilities. Condominium board members have a fiduciary duty to prioritize unit owners' interests. Using confidential information for personal profit to others' disadvantage breaches this duty. While a broker can serve if recused from their own transactions, the described situation is problematic, potentially lowering other unit values. Legal experts recommend reminding the broker of their duties, excluding them from relevant discussions, and seeking resignation or removal if they cannot comply with bylaws.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Q. I am on the board of directors of an Upper West Side condominium. A member of the board is a residential real estate broker who leases and sells apartments in the building — including apartments he’s bought for himself that were substantially below market. As a board member, he has access to privileged resident information, including financials and personal circumstances, giving him an obvious personal advantage in his business deals. Is having this person on the board a breach of our ethical and legal responsibility? What is our obligation? A: Condominium board members have a legal responsibility to put the interests of the association and all unit owners first. When they use the privileged information they have as board members for their own profit if it’s to the disadvantage of other unit owners, that is a breach of their fiduciary duty. There is a way that a broker can buy an apartment in a condominium while serving on the board without violating that fiduciary duty: If the member is not influencing how the board treats the purchase application for that unit, and does not vote on whether the board will exercise its right of first refusal when the unit goes up for sale, then there is no impropriety, said Leni Morrison Cummins , chair of the condominiums and cooperatives practice at Cozen O’Connor in New York. But your situation sounds more egregious. Board members cannot use information they learn in the course of their work for the condominium to influence a buyer or seller, and they cannot use confidential information for their private gain if it harms the condominium or their fellow owners. If this broker is buying units at artificially low prices and then leasing them, he could be dragging down the value of other units. “At a minimum, this broker should be reminded of his fiduciary duties as a board member, and if he cannot fulfill those duties, he should be given the opportunity to resign,” said Andrew I. Bart , senior counsel with Kagan Lubic Lepper Finkelstein & Gold, LLP. The board should send a letter to this broker citing the relevant parts of its governing documents. “He should be kept away from discussions of his own transactions and should be reminded of his fiduciary duties not to use confidential information for himself when it comes to his own transactions in the building,” Mr. Bart said. “That’s a red line.” If your neighbor can’t agree to those demands, he should resign. If he refuses to resign, he should be removed from the board in a process that’s in line with the condo’s bylaws.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/09/realestate/08re-ASK-illo/08re-ASK-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg

239,My Landlord Is Trying to Cheat Me on a Lease Renewal,Jill Terreri Ramos,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/realestate/my-landlord-is-trying-to-cheat-me-on-a-lease-renewal.html,2025-11-15,"A rent-stabilized tenant in Brooklyn received a late lease renewal offer in late August, months after their lease expired in April, and was subsequently billed for retroactive rent increases. Legal experts, including Steven Ben Gordon and Rosalind Black, confirmed that landlords cannot demand retroactive payment for belated lease renewals. New York state law requires landlords to offer renewals 150-90 days before expiration. Landlords who fail to meet this deadline forgo the right to an immediate rent increase. Tenants can choose a later lease start date, typically 90 days after the renewal offer. Tenants facing demands for prior increased rent can file a rent overcharge claim with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Q: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Brooklyn. In late August, I received a new lease with a slight rent increase from my landlord. My lease had expired in April, but she neglected to get the new one to me until months later. I signed the new lease and dated it with the September date. I just received a note from my landlord telling me that my rent increase began in April and that I owe arrears on the months since. Is this correct? Since I didn’t receive the notice until late August, do I owe the difference for the previous months? A: No, a landlord cannot give a rent-stabilized tenant a belated lease renewal and then demand retroactive payment. Since you didn’t have a signed agreement in place after your lease expired, you never agreed to pay the increased amount. “By no means do you have to pay the difference,” said Steven Ben Gordon, a lawyer in Queens who represents tenants. According to New York state law , owners of rent-stabilized apartments must offer a written lease renewal between 150 and 90 days before a lease expires. Tenants have 60 days to sign and return the new lease, and can choose a term of one or two years. If the tenant does not return the renewal to the landlord within 60 days, the owner may refuse to renew the lease. If a landlord fails to offer a lease at least 90 days before the expiration of the current lease, they forgo the right to raise the rent as soon as the law allows, according to the Met Council on Housing , a nonprofit which works with tenants’ to help ensure their rights. Because your landlord offered a late renewal offer, you can choose to have the lease start either on the date the lease would have begun had the offer been on time, or 90 days after the renewal offer was made, said Rosalind Black, citywide housing director at Legal Services NYC. In your case, choosing the later renewal date means that you won’t owe any rent increase until December. You have an executed lease, and you’re not in danger of losing your apartment, Mr. Gordon said. You don’t have to pay for your landlord’s ineptitude. If she still tries to collect the higher rent for the months before December, you can file a rent overcharge claim with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/16/realestate/15RE-Ask-illo/15RE-Ask-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg

Rhode Island officials approved $132 million in state funding over 30 years for its construction, with a condition for mixed-use development including housing and retail on adjacent land. This stadium is part of a trend where professional soccer clubs build lavish facilities, aiming to capitalize on the growing soccer market, generate club revenue, enhance fan experience, and serve as catalysts for local business and neighborhood revitalization.",,The New York Times,Public/Private Development,"Hordes of fans poured through the entrances and into the merchandise store and concessions markets at the newly built Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket, R.I. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon, and Rhode Island F.C. was set to play a nationally televised match against Hartford Athletic. The sellout crowd was filled with parents, children and hard-core hometown supporters who sported the club’s blue and yellow jerseys and T-shirts. With 10,500 seats, the venue, which opened in May, is one of the most expensive lower-tier soccer stadiums in U.S. history. To build the stadium, Rhode Island officials approved a deal in which the state would pay $132 million over 30 years. But a sticking point was that the project must also include mixed-use development with hundreds of housing units, as well as retail stores, along the adjacent riverfront land. Rhode Island F.C. is one of dozens of professional soccer clubs in the United States that have looked to build lavish soccer-specific stadiums — a wave taking hold in small and midsize cities. The projects aim to capitalize on the growing professional soccer market , and provide new revenues for club owners and excellent game-day experiences for fans.

241,The Reign of the Maximalist Couch,Misty White Sidell,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/realestate/fringe-couches-maximalism.html,2025-11-07,"Today's fashionable maximalist couches feature plush cushions, decadent fabrics, and hand-sewn, fringe-embellished skirts, costing $10,000-$60,000. These custom-ordered luxury items, reflecting a Gilded Age aesthetic, serve as a status symbol for the wealthy, differentiating them from minimalist designs. The trend, rooted in 1800s France, has been revived by firms like MBDS and is embraced by younger generations. Trim maker Samuel & Sons reported a 50% sales increase in sofa trims over three years. High material and labor costs, including an estimated $4,000 in embellishment expenses, contribute to their luxury market confinement.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"Today’s most fashionable couches are dressed like Victorian debutantes. The over-the-top designs have plush cushions made of decadent fabrics like French velvet or English botanical prints. They’re sewn by hand, and, most important, stand out for their floor-skimming skirts embellished with fringe and tassels. Once considered a fusty relic, these fringe-embellished couches — often reflecting eccentric color, print and trim combinations — are now seen as the forefront of luxury. They are typically custom orders placed by renowned interior designers, and can cost between $10,000 and $60,000. The look has a history rooted in the Gilded Age. The fact that few stores sell these fringe-accented couches is part of their allure, décor experts say. For many, sofas are a symbol of relaxation and family togetherness, and are chosen for their comfort and utility. For select others, couches have become an opportunity to flex a certain status. This pivot toward more sumptuous sofas, designers say, is an attempt by the wealthy to stand out in a home design market flooded by minimalist sofas from companies like West Elm and Wayfair. To own a fringe sofa is to showcase one’s wealth and access to design expertise. “When you see them, it doesn’t feel like something ordered out of a catalog,” said Emily Eerdmans, the New York-based interior designer and gallerist who has designed many fringe-accented couches for clients in shades of sap green, cerulean and ivory. The concept of embellishing furniture with fringe took off in 1800s France under Napoleon III, and was a favorite design detail of his wife, Empress Eugénie, whose jewels were among the objects stolen from the Louvre in last month’s heist . An appetite for novelty and faster fashion cycles during that time heralded a moment of opulence in both clothing and furniture design, said Freyja Hartzell, an associate professor at the Bard Graduate Center in New York who specializes in the history of modern design, architecture and art. That sentiment eventually made its way across the Atlantic. “It’s the same type of stuff Newport families would have had in their mansions for sure,” Ms. Hartzell said of tassel couches the wealthy had in Newport, R.I., in the Gilded Age. The style’s modern-day revival has been slowly building and can be traced to high-profile design firms like MBDS, which is based in London and New York. It has installed the sofas in aspirational environments like the renovated member’s club Annabel’s in London, which was once a favorite of Princess Diana’s, and the restaurant La Monique in Santa Monica, Calif., where tins of Petrossian caviar are served before a view of the Pacific Ocean. The concept of an ornate couch appears to be an exciting novelty for homeowners under 40. “The younger generation is embracing the past to express their personality through design,” said Heather Dewberry, a founder of the design firm Huff-Dewberry in Atlanta. She added that the couches lend a sense of “cheekiness” to a room due to their use of passementerie, a formal term for artisanal trims. Aaron Aujla, a founder of Green River Project design studio, sells fringe-accented couch designs for about $40,000 to $60,000. Mr. Aujla, who has collaborated with his wife, the fashion designer Emily Adams Bode, on upholstered items, said that pairing them with unexpected materials, like lacquer furniture, can make a room feel more cohesive. There are but a handful of purveyors who sell the kind of passementerie so desired by high-end clients, including bullion fringe, the trim most popular for these couches, which resembles a curtain of small, twisted ropes. Samuel & Sons, a company based in New York City, is a go-to trim maker for design firms like MBDS, Eerdmans and Chroma in San Francisco pricing its fringes often in excess of $100 per yard. In the past three years, sales of fringe and other trims used for sofas have grown by 50 percent, said Michael Cohen, the company’s president. The fact that fringe and other embellishments are so difficult to use may keep them confined to the luxury market for some time. They are sewn on by hand using “giant needles,” said Kim Scodro, a designer based in Chicago, adding that they require the utmost care so the fringe hangs level. Ms. Scodro and other designers said that the material and labor costs required to embellish a sofa with fringe can be more than the price of most people’s entire couches — with about $4,000 in added expenses. But it was one of the trend’s original proponents, Martin Brudnizki, the founder of MBDS, who took the strongest stance on the style. Without trims like fringe, he said, couches some times look like “one big blob.” “I like pieces that have a beginning and an end, they need to be defined by something different,” he said. The passementeries used in his many projects, he said, have come to define this era of his work. But most of the tassel couches he has made will never be seen by the broader public. “So often, you don’t see the opulence,” Mr. Brudnizki said of his work for private residences. “Those people don’t want their houses published.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/07/multimedia/07re-fringe-couches-tfqb/07re-fringe-couches-tfqb-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg

243,Star Home Stager Draws Crowds for Coveted Tag Sale,Alix Strauss and Winnie Au,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/realestate/tag-sale-jason-saft.html,2025-11-07,"Jason Saft, a well-known house-staging expert, hosted his annual tag sale on October 25 at Industry City, Brooklyn. The event, where furniture used for staging was discounted by 60-70% off retail, attracted over 300 shoppers before opening, quadrupling last year's attendance. Approximately 1,100 items, from small decorative pieces to large furniture like couches, were available from his 24,000-square-foot warehouse. Shoppers sought deals, with a $1,500 sofa selling for $700 and Eames chairs for $75. Saft's goal was to sell all items and donate any remaining goods to charity.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"With more than two decades in the real estate business, 117,000 followers on Instagram and profiles in mainstream magazines and design publications, Jason Saft has built a reputation as a house-staging guru. And among his followers and industry professionals, Mr. Saft’s annual tag sale — where he unloads furniture used to stage and sell apartments, discounted at 60 to 70 percent off retail — is a premier event. On the morning of this year’s sale on Oct. 25, the line to get in snaked around the hallway on the 7th floor of his Industry City, Brooklyn building. By 9:30 a.m., half an hour before the sale began, more than 300 shoppers had arrived, looking for a deal. Approximately 1,100 available items ranged from small tchotchkes — vases, decorative balls and light fixtures, priced at a few dollars each — to bigger items, including couches, dining room tables and a vintage wooden bookcase. Products were pulled from the roughly 150,000 items that resided in Mr. Saft’s 24,000-square-foot warehouse and office, four floors below. A $1,500 Lappi sofa was now $700. Eames chairs, originally $250 each, were $75. A skirted table bought from a designer for $900 was $250. Mr. Saft, 48, estimated that 300 people showed up last year, purchasing some 200 items. This year, he gauged, attendance quadrupled. “People trust my eye and feel like they’ll find something interesting,” he said. “And everyone loves a bargain.” Nana Eyeson-Akiwowo, 48, an independent consultant for luxury brands, drove in with a friend from Englewood, N.J., and secured a prime spot in line by 8:15 a.m. “When Jason posted on Instagram that he was doing a Crazy Eddie-style sale, I knew I was coming,” she said. “I love the way he designs.” Ms. Eyeson-Akiwowo was clear about what she was looking for. “Furniture for our master bedroom. And yes, I have furniture already, but I feel like I’m going to find something great,” she said. “In the words of Denzel Washington, ‘I’m leaving here with something.’” As the line grew, the crowd remained calm and unfazed. People stood and strategized with one another; others sat on the floor in groups, drinking coffee, scrolling on their phones and chatting. Some came with their dogs, some with babies. The mood quickly changed when the doors opened promptly at 10 a.m. and the previously placid group angled to get inside. A quick scan of the room revealed piles of pillows, rolls of rugs wrapped in unopened plastic, light fixtures, tables, night stands, and plants. Artwork ranged from $10 to $30, while slabs of marble were free for the taking. Yes, free. The 35-plus couches and about 300 chairs included weathered, outdoor furniture as well as more upscale pieces “that weren’t working aesthetically or were overbought,” Mr. Saft said. Dressed in a denim shirt, khaki pants and brown suede shoes, Mr. Saft circulated like a politician running for office. He greeted everyone warmly and enthusiastically, humbled by the turnout and by those who wanted to meet him. “I worked three jobs and put myself through a working man’s college. I was told at a young age that I wouldn’t grow up to be much,” he said. “I was always in trouble, but I always wanted to accomplish something.” Through his 20s and 30s, Mr. Saft drank heavily and did drugs, and as he puts it, “kind of gave up on life,” he said. “When I turned 40, I got sober. I feel very fortunate. I never imagined I would accomplish something. To see so many people, and how excited they are, gives me a sense of pride I’ve never had before. It’s profound.” Deciding what to part with, Mr. Saft said, was possible in part because of Airtable, the organizational tool, which he uses to log every item his company acquires and track how often an item is used. The list took six weeks to amass, longer than it takes Mr. Saft to stage a home. “Physical staging can take two days,” he said, “If we’re doing cosmetic work, like painting, wallpapering or refinishing floors, and depending upon the size of the home, that can take three days to two weeks.” Currently, Mr. Saft is staging 50 projects, from a 650-square-foot one bedroom to the 10,000-square-foot, five-story, Pfizer Mansion in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. Mr. Saft’s fees start at $22,000 for a one bedroom and can rocket up from there. He recently charged $175,000 to stage a 45-foot wide double townhouse, priced at $75 million. Sarah Kruse, 40, an interior designer and founder of the design company, Storie, was a third-time attendee and found a couch for a client’s office for $1,200, which she bet was originally $3,000. Mark Boyett, 60, an audiobook producer for Bookmark Audio, and his husband, Paresh Patel, came to replace their couch. “Ours is a bit dog-eared,” said Mr. Patel, 56, a city government operations director. “He wants to stick with neutral tones. I want our color to pop. The goal is to remain married after this sample sale. So hopefully we’ll come to a consensus.” Rob Friedman, 38, a freelance filmmaker and editor, probed for items he could sell on Facebook Marketplace. He arrived 10 minutes after the sale began to find “a lot of things had been sold,” he said, as he stood unperturbed by the 30-minute wait to pay. His bags were filled with decorative $1 hanging balls, “which I could sell for $20 a piece,” he said. While serious shoppers came armed with tape measures and photos of their floor plans, others guesstimated. Some marinated. Ms. Eyeson-Akiwowo decided quickly. She beamed as she sat cross-legged on a beautiful velvety silver couch, priced at $450. Her pose reinforced the fact that this was now hers. When Ms. Eyeson-Akiwowo felt a stickiness on the side, she waved away the imperfection. “I’m going to get a cushion cleaner and we’ll be fine,” she said. Shoppers carried out what they could: large plants and small chairs, with pillows and vases balanced on top, rugs slung over shoulders, picture frames held under arms. Mr. Saft’s moving team handled larger pieces with professional moving blankets, clear packing tape and dollies. The frenzy subsided by 11 a.m. Indecisive shoppers sat on couches they were considering; others took additional laps to see if they missed anything. By noon it was slim pickings. Prices had been marked down by an additional 25 to 30 percent. And by 1 p.m., only castoffs remained. For many shoppers, this was a chance to score discounted home goods. For A. Piper McCoy, the sale was a lifeline. “We had a house fire in February and lost everything,” said Ms. McCoy, 39, who lives in West Orange, N.J. and came with her fiancé. Ms. McCoy, the vice president of global communications at the independent ticketing platform, DICE, was up at 6 a.m. for this event. “This sale is allowing us to create new memories. I’m coming in trusting this because of Jason’s background,” she said. Ms. McCoy scored an orange acrylic end table, two green chairs in velvet “and knickknacks that we can add throughout the house to bring back some personality and charm,” she said. That was part of her purchasing goal. Mr. Saft had a goal as well. “I don’t want a single thing left,” he said. “I wanted to give people that feeling and rush of someone who loves a sale. Then I want to give what’s left to charity.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/07/multimedia/07re-stager-sale-mhzk/07re-stager-sale-mhzk-facebookJumbo.jpg

It’s ideal for last-minute play dates, and the activities, like rope ladders and trampolines, are challenging for his kids. “There’s safety,” he said. “With a little risk.” As for the rock cave’s other purpose — a fortified bunker to protect Finns in the event of a military invasion or nuclear bomb — Mr. Kurkijärvi said he never thought about it much until Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. “OK, this is also a civil defense shelter,’” he recalled thinking.

264,New York Lacked an Affordable Housing Portal. So These Teenagers Made One.,Dan Levin,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/realestate/affordable-housing-rent-stabilized-website.html,2025-11-14,"High school seniors Beckett Zahedi and Derrick Webster Jr. launched ""Realer Estate,"" a website to help New Yorkers find affordable and rent-stabilized apartments. Motivated by Beckett's personal experience, the 17-year-olds created the platform after recognizing the city lacked a centralized public database. Beckett taught himself to code, and the site combines public data with real estate listings to identify below-market and rent-stabilized units. Realer Estate has attracted over 27,000 visitors, received praise from New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, and secured investment, aiming to streamline the challenging apartment search process.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"When Beckett Zahedi was in the fifth grade, he’d accompany his recently divorced father and younger sister on a grueling New York City ritual: the hunt for an affordable apartment. On weekends, they’d trudge through fruitless viewings in Brooklyn, jostling through crowds and sidestepping cockroaches until the elder Zahedi finally found a place to rent. “I wanted to make sure that they felt comfortable in the place, and it’s hard to find something, so he had this experience over and over of being rejected,” Caveh Zahedi said of his son. As he got older, Beckett leaned into his entrepreneurial spirit and tech savvy, designing a website where he could sell toys, and hawking T-shirts online. But he never forgot how trying those apartment hunts had been, both emotionally and financially. So last year, as his economics class at the Brooklyn Friends school studied the national housing crisis, he and a classmate hatched an idea for an online housing platform that could help people find homes they could afford. First, he taught himself to code. “I basically spent the first two months of summer in my room, learning from YouTube and A.I.,” said Beckett, 17. “Those are my teachers.” In July, after countless bleary-eyed hours on bedroom computers, he and Derrick Webster Jr., his classmate, launched Realer Estate , a website that combines public data with real estate listings, allowing users to search for below-market and rent-stabilized apartments — something the grown-ups who run New York City have never managed to do. “This is basically the tool that my family needed,” said Beckett, a lanky high school senior with a mop of wavy hair and perhaps the quintessential marker of modern youthful ambition, a LinkedIn profile . “We’d just see, like, one good apartment a month that we can afford. I thought it might be faster, instead of wasting more years, to just create an algorithm that would do that for me.” The site has already attracted more than 27,000 visitors, along with adoration from local officials, including Adrienne Adams, the New York City Council speaker. During a Council meeting in October, Ms. Adams said she was “so impressed with Beckett and his commitment to helping fellow New Yorkers secure affordable housing.” At first, Beckett and Derrick aimed to create a nationwide platform, manually listing properties as far afield as Idaho and Texas. “It was way too much for us to handle,” Beckett said on a recent evening, sitting beside his mother, Amanda Field, in their Brooklyn apartment, as his sister’s loft bed loomed over the dining table. So they decided to focus on New York. “They’re children of the pandemic,” said Ms. Field, who watched Beckett and his friends develop their digital skills during Covid lockdowns and remote schooling. “They were living their real lives in the digital world.” The curious may wonder why two kids who aren’t old enough to vote would even need to create such a platform — as opposed to, say, New York’s vast bureaucracy. A tenant can officially find out if their unit is rent-stabilized by submitting a request to New York State Homes and Community Renewal. But there is no public database of rent-stabilized apartments in the city, only a government website with PDF lists of buildings containing at least one such unit. And those lists may be inaccurate or outdated. The city’s affordable-housing lottery, NYC Housing Connect , typically receives around 500 applications for each unit listed, according to the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Competition is fierce and waits can take years. “There needs to be a more uniform, streamlined way for people to be to be able to find affordable apartments,” said Leah Goodridge, a member of the City Planning Commission. “New Yorkers suffer for it.” At a time when the median rent in the city is about $4,000 , finding one of the roughly one million rent-stabilized apartments often comes down to luck, pluck and patience. Amateur sleuths will pore over obituaries for clues; hunters will bribe landlords with “key money” to obtain a coveted lease. Online, the quest has fueled a cottage industry of tips and advice . “If you’re explicitly looking for a rent-stabilized apartment, then you have to be a big-time hustler,” said Matthew Murphy, executive director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. Beckett and Derrick are trying to make the search easier. While Beckett built the platform over the summer, Derrick, also 17, worked on creating an email system for users. Collaboration was “really, really important,” Derrick said. “Sometimes my new update to the project would crash something that he would make, and he would have to call me at midnight, saying, ‘Hey you messed up something.’” Beckett quickly discovered that building the site was “much harder problem-solving than in my math homework.” “It was just failing, getting every single line wrong until it all fell into place,” he said. His algorithm scans active sales and rental listings, cross-referenced with all rent-stabilized building addresses, and calculates affordability by comparing against similar properties based on categories including bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities and price per square foot. Users can search specifically for rent-stabilized units, or for apartments that the site calculates as affordable. Listings determined to be at least 15 percent below market are saved as “undervalued” on the platform, which links to StreetEasy. “It’s not a perfect estimate, but it helps renters get a better sense of how good of a deal an apartment is,” Beckett said. One local agent, Tiger Liu of Compass, was impressed enough to give the teens $1,000 to advertise, and said his first client from the site recently went into contract on an apartment. “It’s very helpful to people because the current resource is just not enough,” he said. Another backer is Audos, an entrepreneurship start-up, which agreed to invest up to $25,000 in the project — with some oversight. “We’re not handing a 16-year-old kid $25,000 and letting him go crazy,” said Andres Zubillaga, an Audos founder. The company has worked with businesses focused on moving and interior decorating, but “in terms of actually helping you with the apartment search, this is the first we’ve seen,” Mr. Zubillaga said. While the website is largely automated, running it still consumes much of Beckett and Derrick’s time. “Right after school, you make sure you get all your homework done, and then it’s your whole entire night,” Derrick said. Indeed, Realer Estate is a work in progress. Some neighborhoods have few listings, and the affordability scores are not for all budgets. The wrinkles are being ironed out between college applications, schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Beckett has been attending community board meetings to beef up on housing issues, and chose to forgo playing on his school basketball team this year. (“I’m not super good,” he admitted.) But like a lot of kids his age, what he is good at is the internet. Plenty of adults have tried to tackle New York’s affordable-housing problem with limited success, so why not give two high school students a chance? After all, Derrick noted, the housing lottery email notification feature that the City Council will require is similar to the alert system he already built for Realer Estate. “What we want to do is see how we can be more involved with the city, learn from them, take our experience and give back,” Derrick said. “There’s a lot more people we can help.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/14/multimedia/14re-TEENAGER-HOUSING-PLATFORM1-gwmj/14re-TEENAGER-HOUSING-PLATFORM1-gwmj-facebookJumbo.jpg

Solny, 68, was convicted in June of 17 counts, including criminal possession of stolen property and grand larceny, for stealing 11 Brooklyn properties. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun nullified the deeds, allowing homeowners to potentially reclaim their houses, but declined financial restitution for victims, who lost hundreds of thousands in collected rent. Solny previously pleaded guilty in Queens in 2018 to similar crimes, receiving probation, yet continued his fraudulent activities.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Sanford Solny built a fortune by convincing vulnerable homeowners to sign away the deeds to their homes. On Wednesday, the Brooklyn real estate investor was sentenced to up to seven years in prison, closing a long and tangled case that left families in financial ruin. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun also ordered that the deeds to the 11 homes taken by Mr. Solny be nullified — a ruling that could allow some homeowners to reclaim their houses. But Judge Chun declined to grant financial restitution to the victims, including any portion of the hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent that Mr. Solny collected after evicting homeowners and installing his own tenants. The 68-year-old Solny, a former lawyer from Midwood, Brooklyn, who was disbarred following accusations of fraud, was convicted in June of a total of 17 counts , including criminal possession of stolen property, scheme to defraud and grand larceny in connection with the theft of the 11 properties in Brooklyn. His trial in Brooklyn came on the heels of a similar trial in Queens, where in 2018, he pleaded guilty to stealing several other homes and was later sentenced to five years of probation. At least one of the properties in Brooklyn was stolen after his sentencing in Queens — indicating that he continued to defraud people even after being convicted of the same crime in a different borough. “For more than 13 years, my family and I have endured unimaginable hardship in our fight to reclaim the deed to our homes,” said Clotilde Wendpagnangde Sawadogo, an immigrant from Burkina Faso, in a statement that was read to the court. “What should have been a straightforward matter of property rights became a prolonged and devastating ordeal — one that has inflicted deep emotional, physical and psychological harm on every member of our family.” Thank you for your patience while we verify access.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12re-solny-sentencing-01-phjv/12re-solny-sentencing-01-phjv-facebookJumbo.jpg

This occurs despite rent increases outpacing household income growth since 2001. Popular East Coast markets have under 2% of listings below this threshold. However, more than a third of available apartment units in 13 of the 100 largest U.S. metros are under $1,000, including over half in Wichita, KS, and McAllen, TX.

But new research from Zillow reveals that it’s actually fairly common in parts of the South and Midwest. According to researchers , rent increases are outpacing growth in household income since 2001, leaving more Americans to spend over 30 percent of their income on housing — the generally accepted threshold of affordability . In popular East Coast markets like Boston, Miami and Washington, D.C., fewer than 2 percent of apartment listings rent for less than $1,000. But in 13 of the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, more than a third of available apartment units can be rented for $1,000 a month or less. In Wichita, Kan., and McAllen, Texas, it’s more than half. In Little Rock, Ark., Toledo, Ohio, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Okla., it’s not quite half. Apartment seekers have many more opportunities to snag that elusive $1,000 monthly rent if they live with roommates: Zillow found that the median monthly rent for a single room was less than $1,000 in 86 of the 100 U.S. metros examined. Even renting an entire house becomes more feasible when sharing it. In 36 of the 100 largest metros areas, two roommates could rent a median-price single-family home for less than $1,000 apiece. In Toledo, Wichita, Little Rock, and Dayton, Ohio, the median rent for a single-family home is less than $1,500 a month.

271,"Bars, Restaurants and Buildings Take Karaoke Rooms to the Next Level",Alyson Krueger,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/realestate/karaoke-rooms-expensive-new-york.html,2025-11-11,"High-end karaoke rooms are emerging in New York and New Jersey, transforming bars, restaurants, apartment buildings, and private homes. These spaces, like Beatbox in West Village, offer sophisticated sound systems, AI-powered games, and lavish designs, such as Coqodaq's room with Swarovski crystals. Residential developments, including 1289 Lexington and RiverHouse 11, also feature expensive, custom-built karaoke amenities. Individuals like Darren and Rilke McNeill are creating advanced home setups. The trend emphasizes high-tech, social experiences designed to draw people together for entertainment.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"Beatbox, a dimly-lit karaoke bar in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan, is outfitted with plush-velvet poofs and decorated with vintage vinyls and large photographs of concerts by artists like Lil Uzi Vert and Chappell Roan. There are three private karaoke suites, one of which can fit 70 people. Performers stand on a stage with a wall made up of LED lights behind them, the lyrics of their selected song displayed on a 65-inch TV, belting into professional-grade microphones. In October, Chelsea Lipscomb-LeSane, 31, a creative producer who lives in Fairfield County, Conn., attended an album release party at the venue, which opened to the public on Nov. 1. She knew right away that it was no dive bar karaoke experience. “It feels like a mix between your coolest friend’s living room and a high-end recording studio,” she said. Beatbox is one of many high-end karaoke spaces opening in New York and New Jersey restaurants, apartment buildings and even private homes. These spaces incorporate sophisticated sound systems and proprietary software — and often are fitted with lounge areas suited for a rock star. The owners of Beatbox, Sara Goodison and Lannie Rosenfield Rydell, who met at Stanford University’s business school, spent six months renovating the space, which used to be a Black Tap burger restaurant (They said they found five milkshake machines during the build out.) Singers can opt to freestyle songs or play one of two games built specifically for Beatbox that use artificial intelligence. One awards points for hitting the right notes — “It is like Guitar Hero,” said Ms. Goodison — while the other scores you based on how well you know the lyrics of the songs. Performers can also use karaoke filters and auto-tune to make their singing higher or add vibrato. “It’s like an Instagram filter for your voice,” said Ms. Rosenfield Rydell. Ms. Goodison wanted to get people off their phones and into social spaces. “We really looked at leveraging that technology, which is keeping people isolated and at home and alone,” she said. “If we are going to create a place that people are motivated to come to and spend time, it has to be this high tech experience.” But Beatbox is not the only karaoke bar in town. When Simon Kim opened Coqodaq, a fried chicken restaurant in New York City, he knew he wanted to have a karaoke room. “I am Korean, and in Korea karaoke is a huge thing,” he said. But understanding that social media had allowed everyone to make content from their couch, he knew he had to create a compelling space. So he tapped David Rockwell, the architect and designer behind the restaurant, to build the “sickest karaoke room,” said Mr. Kim. Mr. Rockwell, who said this was his first time tackling a karaoke room, filled the 450-square-foot space with a large stage, embellished with 1,200 meters of Swarovski crystals. The side walls of the stage are made of a dark cork suited for sound proofing, and there are movable banquettes to fit different party sizes. The room was first plotted out as a 3-D model and took three months to build. Mr. Kim said the cost was on the level of a luxury car. Even residential buildings are getting in on the singing action. At 1289 Lexington, an apartment building that opened two years ago on the Upper East Side, there is a $300,000 karaoke room that has heavy metal doors for sound proofing; 16 speakers; acoustically absorptive materials and a green screen for making music videos. The idea was to create a space where teenagers could get off their phones, said Jill Bernard, the building’s director of sales. “Play rooms are standard, and they are beautiful, but what happens when you are 10 and 12 and want an amenity that connects people and makes them smile,” she said. (Teens are still on their phones in the room. But at least they are making videos together.) In RiverHouse 11, a high rise in Weehawken, N.J., residents have access to a karaoke facility that comes with four Fender Stratocaster guitars, a Yamaha piano keyboard and four Marshall amps. Then there is the private home variety. When they moved into a new house in Warwick, N.Y., in 2023, Darren McNeill, 38, who works in automotive sales and operations, and his wife, Rilke, 43, a physical therapist, turned their basement into a high-tech karaoke room and home theater. “We wanted a place where we could go down and escape from things,” Mr. McNeill said. They use an iPad to cast music videos onto a large-screen TV. It is connected to two speakers, optimally placed for the best acoustics. They sing along to the videos with a karaoke machine they bought on Amazon for a few hundred dollars; it came with a 12-inch woofer, two microphones and party lights. But just like in the commercial spaces, their karaoke room is meant for community. Mr. McNeill said friends now invite themselves over to jam out. “We are either legendary or notorious for it, depending on who you ask,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/11/multimedia/11re-karaoke-rooms-03-fqhg/11re-karaoke-rooms-03-fqhg-facebookJumbo.jpg
272,French Chateau Moves In Next to English Tudors,Tim McKeough,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/realestate/birmingham-alabama-designers-french-chateau.html,2025-11-11,"Kevin and Leigh Misso, owners of River Brook design and construction, built a 6,500-square-foot house in Homewood, Ala. Designed after a 19th-century French chateau, its exterior features buff mortar wash, limestone, arched openings, and a turret. The interior blends antiques with modern pieces, inspired by Parisian apartments. Seeking a larger home for their three children, the Missos purchased a damaged lot in March 2023 for $450,000. Construction, costing roughly $4 million, was completed by April. The house reflects their personal style and travel experiences, providing a large space for their family.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"When Kevin and Leigh Misso began designing their new house in Homewood, Ala., a Birmingham suburb, they weren’t shy about creating exactly the kind of structure they loved most. “We designed the house after a 19th-century French chateau,” said Ms. Misso, 38. “We love traveling in Europe and acquiring antiques,” she said, especially when roaming throughout France. Never mind that the home would be on a street lined with tightly clustered houses built in the 20th century, ranging from homes with neoclassical columns to low-slung bungalows. The area’s architectural hodgepodge seemed to give the couple license to play. “There are English Tudors and some homes with Spanish influence,” Ms. Misso said. “We thought it would be interesting to incorporate some French architecture on our street.” The couple were well positioned to build whatever they wanted. Together, they are the owners of River Brook , a design and construction company that takes the initial sketch to a move-in-ready home. Ms. Misso is the lead designer and Mr. Misso is the director of construction. The Missos previously lived one street over from their current location. But as they had more children — they now have three, aged 3 to 7 — and their youngsters grew, they began to think that it would be nice to have a larger house and a larger yard. “It was about the kids just being able to run and play, and having a yard big enough where all the neighborhood kids could come and play flag football,” said Mr. Misso, 42. In 2023, a massive tree fell on the house behind their former home and caused serious damage, collapsing the roof and compromising a foundation wall. Aware that their octogenarian neighbors had already thought about moving elsewhere, the Missos struck a deal to buy the lot with plans to tear the structure down and replace it. They closed that March for $450,000 and got to work. When designing the new house, Ms. Misso said, “I wanted it to feel like it had been there for 200 years.” The resulting two-story, 6,500-square-foot house is finished with a buff mortar wash and limestone blocks that frame the windows, doorways and outside corners. At the front, one side of the house has an outdoor room within an arcade of arched openings. Ms. Misso wanted a place where she could watch her children play, but an ordinary wood-framed porch wouldn’t fit the character of the house. “Front porches can feel really farmhouse,” she said. Masonry offered the solidity and grandeur she desired. On the other side of the house, she added a turret, which contains a sitting area for the primary suite on the ground floor and a play area for the children above. Inside, the conical ceiling is painted with red and white stripes. “We painted the ceiling of the turret to look like a circus tent,” Ms. Misso said. Indeed, throughout the interiors, she deliberately mixed fine antiques, many of which the couple purchased at Paris flea markets, with contemporary furniture, lighting and art, while adding a few whimsical touches. Although the exterior was inspired by French chateaus, she wanted the interior to feel more like a present-day Parisian apartment, she said, “where you walk in and there’s all this trim, casework and classic architectural detailing, but then you see this juxtaposition with modern art and modern furnishings.” In the foyer, a contemporary chandelier of draped yarn from the Mexican company CoLores Decor hangs above a 19th-century Italian bust on a fluted pedestal. In the living room, an 18th-century tapestry, restored by an artisan in Paris, adorns a traditionally paneled wall above a hefty new rose marble coffee table from Four Hands. In the kitchen, reclaimed 150-year-old wood beams, an antiqued mirror and a crystal chandelier give the appearance of age, but a bright blue free-form wall sculpture by Montana Moore adds a contemporary twist. Even the connected screened porch has a playfully high-contrast look. Equipped with black and white striped curtains, the porch’s wood ceiling and valance are painted in coordinating stripes to look as if the space has been draped completely in fabric. By the time the house was ready for the family to move into in April, construction had cost roughly $4 million. Now, the Missos have a house they love, where the children can play indoors or out, and where the parents continually encounter reminders of the places they’ve visited, and the artists and antiques dealers they’ve met along the way. “I was sitting in the living room the other day just looking at that tapestry, and thinking about all of the rooms that thing has been in and what it has probably seen,” Ms. Misso said. “We look around and love seeing things that have a history and a story behind them,” she added. “We’re just so thankful that we get to call this home.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/10/multimedia/00re-location-birmingham-wzcf/00re-location-birmingham-wzcf-facebookJumbo.jpg

Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room. But still, there are “a few things that we don’t have here,” Mr. Staluppi said, like a private bathroom inside his office. So, he’ll probably buy a bigger boat.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/08/multimedia/08re-superyachts-lkwh/08re-superyachts-lkwh-facebookJumbo.jpg

275,There’s a Real Estate Agent on My Condo Board. Isn’t That a Bad Idea?,Jill Terreri Ramos,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/realestate/condo-boards-conflict-of-interest.html,2025-11-08,"An Upper West Side condominium board member questioned the legality and ethics of a fellow board member, a real estate broker, who sells units and buys apartments for himself ""substantially below market."" This broker uses privileged resident information for personal business advantage, potentially breaching fiduciary duty. Experts state board members must prioritize the association and unit owners; using confidential information for private gain that harms others is a breach. While a broker can buy units without impropriety if not influencing their own transactions, this situation is described as ""egregious."" Legal advice suggests reminding the broker of their duties, excluding them from personal transaction discussions, and demanding resignation or removal if duties are not fulfilled.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Q. I am on the board of directors of an Upper West Side condominium. A member of the board is a residential real estate broker who leases and sells apartments in the building — including apartments he’s bought for himself that were substantially below market. As a board member, he has access to privileged resident information, including financials and personal circumstances, giving him an obvious personal advantage in his business deals. Is having this person on the board a breach of our ethical and legal responsibility? What is our obligation? A: Condominium board members have a legal responsibility to put the interests of the association and all unit owners first. When they use the privileged information they have as board members for their own profit if it’s to the disadvantage of other unit owners, that is a breach of their fiduciary duty. There is a way that a broker can buy an apartment in a condominium while serving on the board without violating that fiduciary duty: If the member is not influencing how the board treats the purchase application for that unit, and does not vote on whether the board will exercise its right of first refusal when the unit goes up for sale, then there is no impropriety, said Leni Morrison Cummins , chair of the condominiums and cooperatives practice at Cozen O’Connor in New York. But your situation sounds more egregious. Board members cannot use information they learn in the course of their work for the condominium to influence a buyer or seller, and they cannot use confidential information for their private gain if it harms the condominium or their fellow owners. If this broker is buying units at artificially low prices and then leasing them, he could be dragging down the value of other units. “At a minimum, this broker should be reminded of his fiduciary duties as a board member, and if he cannot fulfill those duties, he should be given the opportunity to resign,” said Andrew I. Bart , senior counsel with Kagan Lubic Lepper Finkelstein & Gold, LLP. The board should send a letter to this broker citing the relevant parts of its governing documents. “He should be kept away from discussions of his own transactions and should be reminded of his fiduciary duties not to use confidential information for himself when it comes to his own transactions in the building,” Mr. Bart said. “That’s a red line.” If your neighbor can’t agree to those demands, he should resign. If he refuses to resign, he should be removed from the board in a process that’s in line with the condo’s bylaws.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/09/realestate/08re-ASK-illo/08re-ASK-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg

277,My Landlord Is Trying to Cheat Me on a Lease Renewal,Jill Terreri Ramos,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/realestate/my-landlord-is-trying-to-cheat-me-on-a-lease-renewal.html,2025-11-15,"A rent-stabilized tenant in Brooklyn received a lease renewal in late August for an April-expired lease, with the landlord demanding retroactive rent increases. Legal experts, including Steven Ben Gordon, confirm landlords cannot demand arrears for belated renewals. New York state law mandates landlords offer renewals 150-90 days before expiration. If offered late, landlords forgo the right to immediate rent increases. Tenants can choose the lease start date to be either the original expiry or 90 days after the late offer. The tenant does not owe back payments and can file a rent overcharge claim if the landlord persists.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Q: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Brooklyn. In late August, I received a new lease with a slight rent increase from my landlord. My lease had expired in April, but she neglected to get the new one to me until months later. I signed the new lease and dated it with the September date. I just received a note from my landlord telling me that my rent increase began in April and that I owe arrears on the months since. Is this correct? Since I didn’t receive the notice until late August, do I owe the difference for the previous months? A: No, a landlord cannot give a rent-stabilized tenant a belated lease renewal and then demand retroactive payment. Since you didn’t have a signed agreement in place after your lease expired, you never agreed to pay the increased amount. “By no means do you have to pay the difference,” said Steven Ben Gordon, a lawyer in Queens who represents tenants. According to New York state law , owners of rent-stabilized apartments must offer a written lease renewal between 150 and 90 days before a lease expires. Tenants have 60 days to sign and return the new lease, and can choose a term of one or two years. If the tenant does not return the renewal to the landlord within 60 days, the owner may refuse to renew the lease. If a landlord fails to offer a lease at least 90 days before the expiration of the current lease, they forgo the right to raise the rent as soon as the law allows, according to the Met Council on Housing , a nonprofit which works with tenants’ to help ensure their rights. Because your landlord offered a late renewal offer, you can choose to have the lease start either on the date the lease would have begun had the offer been on time, or 90 days after the renewal offer was made, said Rosalind Black, citywide housing director at Legal Services NYC. In your case, choosing the later renewal date means that you won’t owe any rent increase until December. You have an executed lease, and you’re not in danger of losing your apartment, Mr. Gordon said. You don’t have to pay for your landlord’s ineptitude. If she still tries to collect the higher rent for the months before December, you can file a rent overcharge claim with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/16/realestate/15RE-Ask-illo/15RE-Ask-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg
278,Can Soccer Stadiums Revitalize American Cities?,Danielle McLean and Cody O’Loughlin,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/realestate/soccer-specific-stadium-pawtucket.html,2025-11-12,"Centreville Bank Stadium, home to Rhode Island F.C., opened in Pawtucket, R.I., in May, funded by $132 million in state money over 30 years, conditional on mixed-use development. This stadium is part of a trend of expensive soccer-specific venues in small and midsize U.S. cities, aiming to revitalize areas and generate revenue. However, a New York Times review found that associated mixed-use components, particularly housing, are often delayed or incomplete. Experts question whether these projects deliver promised economic benefits. While some, like the Colorado Switchbacks, have partially completed development increasing revenue, the Rhode Island F.C. group may seek additional public funding to complete its mixed-use portion.",,The New York Times,Public/Private Development,"Hordes of fans poured through the entrances and into the merchandise store and concessions markets at the newly built Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket, R.I. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon, and Rhode Island F.C. was set to play a nationally televised match against Hartford Athletic. The sellout crowd was filled with parents, children and hard-core hometown supporters who sported the club’s blue and yellow jerseys and T-shirts. With 10,500 seats, the venue, which opened in May, is one of the most expensive lower-tier soccer stadiums in U.S. history. To build the stadium, Rhode Island officials approved a deal in which the state would pay $132 million over 30 years. But a sticking point was that the project must also include mixed-use development with hundreds of housing units, as well as retail stores, along the adjacent riverfront land. Rhode Island F.C. is one of dozens of professional soccer clubs in the United States that have looked to build lavish soccer-specific stadiums — a wave taking hold in small and midsize cities. The projects aim to capitalize on the growing professional soccer market , and provide new revenues for club owners and excellent game-day experiences for fans. Often located downtown or on prime real estate, they are promoted as catalysts for local business and neighborhood revitalization. But a New York Times review of U.S. professional soccer-specific stadium projects found that the mixed-use development components, particularly ones that include housing, are often delayed or, to date, are incomplete. And those projects, experts say, don’t always bring in the revenue and economic activity that are promised. Officials could justify using public funding to help build a stadium, because they believe it could benefit the community in the way that a public park might, said Andrew Zimbalist , an economics professor and stadium finance expert at Smith College in Massachusetts. “But going around and suggesting that these things revivify local downtowns, or attract new investment to the economy, and grow employment and living standards,” he said, “the evidence is that it doesn’t happen.” New high-priced soccer cathedrals for clubs in Major League Soccer, the top U.S. men’s professional league, have been built or are underway in large cities such as New York , Los Angeles and Miami . But the bulk of soccer-specific stadiums in the country have been built or planned for lower-tiered clubs in smaller cities. At least 50 stadiums have been completed or are in the planning or development process for soccer clubs that compete in various tiers of the United Soccer League, the M.L.S. development league, or in the top-tiered National Women’s Soccer League . Among those stadiums, more than two dozen were completed in 2020 or later or are currently being planned or developed. As the number of stadiums being constructed has gone up, so has the price. For instance, Sacramento Republic F.C. — which, like Rhode Island F.C., plays in the U.S.L. Championship — built its privately funded 11,000-seat stadium for just $3 million in 2014. The club is now in the process of replacing it with a $175 million, 12,000-seat stadium in the city’s Railyards district. Sports ownership groups view mixed-use development as an important tool to generate revenue that would help them chip away at the high price of buying a franchise , and many have turned to commercial assets recently to diversify their revenue streams, according to a 2024 report from the consulting firm Deloitte . Such developments have been constructed around the stadiums of N.F.L. franchises like the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots, and are a central part of the Washington Commanders’ $3.8 billion stadium project . Owning a stadium and the surrounding mixed-use developments affects a club’s valuation, said Pete Giorgio , who leads Deloitte’s global and U.S. sports practice. The exact amount, however, is hard to quantify, he continued, since there are so many different factors: the stadium’s size and age; whether the stadium is in the city center or on the periphery of the metro area; whether the venue can host concerts and other nonsporting events; and whether the group owns the stadium, the land it’s on and the entertainment district around it. “Things get a little bit complicated in terms of how these things are set up,” Mr. Giorgio said. But, he added, “every team that is looking at renovating or rebuilding, or building a stadium or arena right now is absolutely looking to see if they can do a mixed-use development around it.” The Rhode Island ownership group, headed by partners of the real estate development firm Fortuitous Partners , believed building a stadium with state-of-the-art amenities was critical to creating the best possible fan experience, said Dan Kroeber, a club founder. Rhode Island F.C. hopes to rise into the top-tiered ranks on par with M.L.S. after the U.S.L. launches a first-division league, planned for 2027-28, and an eventual promotion and relegation system in which successful lower-tier clubs can climb the ranks and losing teams fall down the ladder. “This has always been about bringing sports to phenomenal, what we call, underserved, markets like Rhode Island,” said Brett M. Johnson , co-founder of Rhode Island F.C. “But it all comes down to the facility.” Jeff Buell is among those vying for a U.S.L. club and a high-priced stadium. His project’s investment group, led by Mr. Buell’s real estate firm, Sequence Development , has proposed a $150 million , 8,000-seat soccer stadium in downtown Albany, N.Y. (The group also includes Rhode Island F.C. investors.) Mr. Buell pitched the stadium as part of a greater $600 million project that would build and renovate several new residential buildings totaling more than 1,000 units, and have more than 100,000 square feet of commercial space on eight acres of underused land. If Mr. Buell could obtain the land, $150 million in public funds and approval from the city, he said, the project would inject new life into a downtown that hasn’t fully recovered since people began to work remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The neighborhoods that are in and around the downtown desperately need some new energy,” Mr. Buell said. “We think that we can be a jumping-off point for that.” But executing mixed-use development around the stadium could prove challenging. At least 12 professional soccer-specific stadium projects that have been completed since 2000 have included mixed-use development with housing as part of the proposal. None have been fully realized, but five have been partially completed. Nineteen other projects with housing baked into their mixed-use development have been proposed or are undergoing construction. Many of those projects are in small or midsize cities such as Grand Rapids, Mich.; Des Moines; and Rogers, Ark. None of the 600,000 square feet designated for housing, retail, bars, restaurants and commercial space as part of the Colorado Rapids’ $183 million stadium project in Commerce City, Colo., for instance, has yet been realized. The stadium opened in 2007. The Rapids’ ownership group is still exploring mixed-use possibilities with city leaders, while evaluating its operations and the land around the stadium, Mike Neary, the group’s executive vice president of business operations and real estate, said in a statement. There’s always an intention for developers and stadium owners to follow through on the mixed-use development portion of stadium projects, said Erin Talkington , managing director of RCLCO, a real estate consulting firm. But the results are mixed when it comes to whether that development actually materializes — or does so at the scope and time frame that city officials expect, she said. Most professional sports team ownership groups don’t have much real estate experience, and are often forced to go back to the drawing board on the mixed-use development aspect of the project when it comes time to actually plan it, Ms. Talkington said. The U.S.L. president, Paul McDonough , argues that clubs have learned how to turn development around their stadiums into a focal point of their city. The Colorado Switchbacks, a U.S.L. Championship club, have completed the first phase of their plans to build apartments and retail around their 8,000-seat stadium , which opened in 2021 in Colorado Springs. The project has quadrupled the revenues of the club, which had struggled financially after debuting in 2015 , Mr. McDonough said. “Now they have a great value,” he said. “They are part of the community.” When Centreville Bank Stadium in Rhode Island is completed, a gravel lot beside it will be replaced by 250 apartment units and roughly 30,000 square feet of retail, including about 10 restaurants and shops, Mr. Kroeber said. A new pedestrian bridge will connect the site to two additional apartment buildings, which will total more than 300 housing units. The stadium itself is on land that was contaminated by a decommissioned manufactured gas plant. Rhode Island Energy and Fortuitous Partners remediated the site to make way for the stadium project, Mr. Kroeber said. The new development “brings life to the area,” said David Peart, Rhode Island F.C.’s president. “It’s not just people coming here for soccer and leaving — it’s folks coming here to live.” Still, building lower-tier soccer stadiums on valuable urban real estate provides few economic benefits, said Mr. Zimbalist, the economics professor. Those stadiums are often used fewer than 50 times throughout the year between soccer games, concerts and high school tournaments — many of which don’t sell out and last only a few hours, he said. “Are you going to want to build a restaurant next to that?” Mr. Zimbalist said. “Are you going to want to build a bar next to that? You’re going to want to build a hotel next to that?” Mr. Zimbalist previously worked as a paid consultant for the city of Worcester, Mass., during its successful bid to build a new minor league baseball stadium and lure the Boston Red Sox’s Class AAA affiliate to the city. He developed a model that tried to estimate the net financial effect of the project over time and engaged in negotiations with the team. In 2023, two years after the stadium opened, Mr. Zimbalist wrote that it was possible that short term the financial outcomes would be worse than his model predicted due to pandemic-related delays. Stadiums can yield similar economic returns to what a city may get from a Target department store, said Peter Boumgarden, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies stadium financing . Mr. Kroeber said the Pawtucket stadium has hosted professional men’s and women’s rugby events and will eventually host a first-division U.S.L. women’s soccer team, concerts and athletic events held by local universities. The vote to approve state funding to help pay for the stadium was narrowly decided in 2022, with Gov. Daniel McKee casting the tiebreaking vote . Michael McNally, who was one of the five members of the state commerce board who voted against the stadium, said he doubted the mixed-use development would ever get built. But if the ownership group does complete it as originally envisioned without any additional state subsidies, Mr. McNally said he would concede that the project was “a great deal.” Mr. Kroeber vowed that the mixed-use development portion would definitely happen, and said that the group is working on designs and getting the needed permits to break ground on the project. But there is a possibility that the club will seek additional public funding to complete it, he said. “This is prime real estate that will become the destination of why people are coming to Pawtucket,” Mr. Kroeber said. The benefits of having Rhode Island F.C. and the stadium in Pawtucket extend beyond economics, Mayor Donald Grebien said. It allows the city to remain a sports and entertainment hub after losing the Pawtucket Red So",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/07/10re-stadium-housing-86702-cover/10re-stadium-housing-86702-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg
279,The Reign of the Maximalist Couch,Misty White Sidell,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/realestate/fringe-couches-maximalism.html,2025-11-07,"Maximalist couches, featuring decadent fabrics, hand-sewn fringe, and tassels, are a growing luxury trend in home design. These custom-ordered sofas, costing $10,000-$60,000, allow wealthy buyers to signal status and differentiate from minimalist styles. The aesthetic, rooted in the Gilded Age and 1800s France, is experiencing a modern revival driven by firms like MBDS. Sales of sofa trims have increased 50% in three years. High material and labor costs, adding about $4,000 per sofa, keep these elaborate designs primarily within the luxury market, though younger homeowners are also adopting the style.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"Today’s most fashionable couches are dressed like Victorian debutantes. The over-the-top designs have plush cushions made of decadent fabrics like French velvet or English botanical prints. They’re sewn by hand, and, most important, stand out for their floor-skimming skirts embellished with fringe and tassels. Once considered a fusty relic, these fringe-embellished couches — often reflecting eccentric color, print and trim combinations — are now seen as the forefront of luxury. They are typically custom orders placed by renowned interior designers, and can cost between $10,000 and $60,000. The look has a history rooted in the Gilded Age. The fact that few stores sell these fringe-accented couches is part of their allure, décor experts say. For many, sofas are a symbol of relaxation and family togetherness, and are chosen for their comfort and utility. For select others, couches have become an opportunity to flex a certain status. This pivot toward more sumptuous sofas, designers say, is an attempt by the wealthy to stand out in a home design market flooded by minimalist sofas from companies like West Elm and Wayfair. To own a fringe sofa is to showcase one’s wealth and access to design expertise. “When you see them, it doesn’t feel like something ordered out of a catalog,” said Emily Eerdmans, the New York-based interior designer and gallerist who has designed many fringe-accented couches for clients in shades of sap green, cerulean and ivory. The concept of embellishing furniture with fringe took off in 1800s France under Napoleon III, and was a favorite design detail of his wife, Empress Eugénie, whose jewels were among the objects stolen from the Louvre in last month’s heist . An appetite for novelty and faster fashion cycles during that time heralded a moment of opulence in both clothing and furniture design, said Freyja Hartzell, an associate professor at the Bard Graduate Center in New York who specializes in the history of modern design, architecture and art. That sentiment eventually made its way across the Atlantic. “It’s the same type of stuff Newport families would have had in their mansions for sure,” Ms. Hartzell said of tassel couches the wealthy had in Newport, R.I., in the Gilded Age. The style’s modern-day revival has been slowly building and can be traced to high-profile design firms like MBDS, which is based in London and New York. It has installed the sofas in aspirational environments like the renovated member’s club Annabel’s in London, which was once a favorite of Princess Diana’s, and the restaurant La Monique in Santa Monica, Calif., where tins of Petrossian caviar are served before a view of the Pacific Ocean. The concept of an ornate couch appears to be an exciting novelty for homeowners under 40. “The younger generation is embracing the past to express their personality through design,” said Heather Dewberry, a founder of the design firm Huff-Dewberry in Atlanta. She added that the couches lend a sense of “cheekiness” to a room due to their use of passementerie, a formal term for artisanal trims. Aaron Aujla, a founder of Green River Project design studio, sells fringe-accented couch designs for about $40,000 to $60,000. Mr. Aujla, who has collaborated with his wife, the fashion designer Emily Adams Bode, on upholstered items, said that pairing them with unexpected materials, like lacquer furniture, can make a room feel more cohesive. There are but a handful of purveyors who sell the kind of passementerie so desired by high-end clients, including bullion fringe, the trim most popular for these couches, which resembles a curtain of small, twisted ropes. Samuel & Sons, a company based in New York City, is a go-to trim maker for design firms like MBDS, Eerdmans and Chroma in San Francisco pricing its fringes often in excess of $100 per yard. In the past three years, sales of fringe and other trims used for sofas have grown by 50 percent, said Michael Cohen, the company’s president. The fact that fringe and other embellishments are so difficult to use may keep them confined to the luxury market for some time. They are sewn on by hand using “giant needles,” said Kim Scodro, a designer based in Chicago, adding that they require the utmost care so the fringe hangs level. Ms. Scodro and other designers said that the material and labor costs required to embellish a sofa with fringe can be more than the price of most people’s entire couches — with about $4,000 in added expenses. But it was one of the trend’s original proponents, Martin Brudnizki, the founder of MBDS, who took the strongest stance on the style. Without trims like fringe, he said, couches some times look like “one big blob.” “I like pieces that have a beginning and an end, they need to be defined by something different,” he said. The passementeries used in his many projects, he said, have come to define this era of his work. But most of the tassel couches he has made will never be seen by the broader public. “So often, you don’t see the opulence,” Mr. Brudnizki said of his work for private residences. “Those people don’t want their houses published.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/07/multimedia/07re-fringe-couches-tfqb/07re-fringe-couches-tfqb-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg

281,Star Home Stager Draws Crowds for Coveted Tag Sale,Alix Strauss and Winnie Au,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/realestate/tag-sale-jason-saft.html,2025-11-07,"Home staging guru Jason Saft held his annual tag sale on October 25th in Industry City, Brooklyn, attracting significant crowds. Over 300 shoppers arrived before the 10 a.m. opening, with attendance estimated to have quadrupled from the previous year. Saft offered approximately 1,100 items—from small decorative pieces to couches—discounted 60-70% off retail prices. Shoppers sought deals on furniture and decor from Saft's extensive warehouse inventory. The event saw rapid sales, with prices reduced further by noon. Saft's goal was to sell all items, with remaining goods slated for charity.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"With more than two decades in the real estate business, 117,000 followers on Instagram and profiles in mainstream magazines and design publications, Jason Saft has built a reputation as a house-staging guru. And among his followers and industry professionals, Mr. Saft’s annual tag sale — where he unloads furniture used to stage and sell apartments, discounted at 60 to 70 percent off retail — is a premier event. On the morning of this year’s sale on Oct. 25, the line to get in snaked around the hallway on the 7th floor of his Industry City, Brooklyn building. By 9:30 a.m., half an hour before the sale began, more than 300 shoppers had arrived, looking for a deal. Approximately 1,100 available items ranged from small tchotchkes — vases, decorative balls and light fixtures, priced at a few dollars each — to bigger items, including couches, dining room tables and a vintage wooden bookcase. Products were pulled from the roughly 150,000 items that resided in Mr. Saft’s 24,000-square-foot warehouse and office, four floors below. A $1,500 Lappi sofa was now $700. Eames chairs, originally $250 each, were $75. A skirted table bought from a designer for $900 was $250. Mr. Saft, 48, estimated that 300 people showed up last year, purchasing some 200 items. This year, he gauged, attendance quadrupled. “People trust my eye and feel like they’ll find something interesting,” he said. “And everyone loves a bargain.” Nana Eyeson-Akiwowo, 48, an independent consultant for luxury brands, drove in with a friend from Englewood, N.J., and secured a prime spot in line by 8:15 a.m. “When Jason posted on Instagram that he was doing a Crazy Eddie-style sale, I knew I was coming,” she said. “I love the way he designs.” Ms. Eyeson-Akiwowo was clear about what she was looking for. “Furniture for our master bedroom. And yes, I have furniture already, but I feel like I’m going to find something great,” she said. “In the words of Denzel Washington, ‘I’m leaving here with something.’” As the line grew, the crowd remained calm and unfazed. People stood and strategized with one another; others sat on the floor in groups, drinking coffee, scrolling on their phones and chatting. Some came with their dogs, some with babies. The mood quickly changed when the doors opened promptly at 10 a.m. and the previously placid group angled to get inside. A quick scan of the room revealed piles of pillows, rolls of rugs wrapped in unopened plastic, light fixtures, tables, night stands, and plants. Artwork ranged from $10 to $30, while slabs of marble were free for the taking. Yes, free. The 35-plus couches and about 300 chairs included weathered, outdoor furniture as well as more upscale pieces “that weren’t working aesthetically or were overbought,” Mr. Saft said. Dressed in a denim shirt, khaki pants and brown suede shoes, Mr. Saft circulated like a politician running for office. He greeted everyone warmly and enthusiastically, humbled by the turnout and by those who wanted to meet him. “I worked three jobs and put myself through a working man’s college. I was told at a young age that I wouldn’t grow up to be much,” he said. “I was always in trouble, but I always wanted to accomplish something.” Through his 20s and 30s, Mr. Saft drank heavily and did drugs, and as he puts it, “kind of gave up on life,” he said. “When I turned 40, I got sober. I feel very fortunate. I never imagined I would accomplish something. To see so many people, and how excited they are, gives me a sense of pride I’ve never had before. It’s profound.” Deciding what to part with, Mr. Saft said, was possible in part because of Airtable, the organizational tool, which he uses to log every item his company acquires and track how often an item is used. The list took six weeks to amass, longer than it takes Mr. Saft to stage a home. “Physical staging can take two days,” he said, “If we’re doing cosmetic work, like painting, wallpapering or refinishing floors, and depending upon the size of the home, that can take three days to two weeks.” Currently, Mr. Saft is staging 50 projects, from a 650-square-foot one bedroom to the 10,000-square-foot, five-story, Pfizer Mansion in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. Mr. Saft’s fees start at $22,000 for a one bedroom and can rocket up from there. He recently charged $175,000 to stage a 45-foot wide double townhouse, priced at $75 million. Sarah Kruse, 40, an interior designer and founder of the design company, Storie, was a third-time attendee and found a couch for a client’s office for $1,200, which she bet was originally $3,000. Mark Boyett, 60, an audiobook producer for Bookmark Audio, and his husband, Paresh Patel, came to replace their couch. “Ours is a bit dog-eared,” said Mr. Patel, 56, a city government operations director. “He wants to stick with neutral tones. I want our color to pop. The goal is to remain married after this sample sale. So hopefully we’ll come to a consensus.” Rob Friedman, 38, a freelance filmmaker and editor, probed for items he could sell on Facebook Marketplace. He arrived 10 minutes after the sale began to find “a lot of things had been sold,” he said, as he stood unperturbed by the 30-minute wait to pay. His bags were filled with decorative $1 hanging balls, “which I could sell for $20 a piece,” he said. While serious shoppers came armed with tape measures and photos of their floor plans, others guesstimated. Some marinated. Ms. Eyeson-Akiwowo decided quickly. She beamed as she sat cross-legged on a beautiful velvety silver couch, priced at $450. Her pose reinforced the fact that this was now hers. When Ms. Eyeson-Akiwowo felt a stickiness on the side, she waved away the imperfection. “I’m going to get a cushion cleaner and we’ll be fine,” she said. Shoppers carried out what they could: large plants and small chairs, with pillows and vases balanced on top, rugs slung over shoulders, picture frames held under arms. Mr. Saft’s moving team handled larger pieces with professional moving blankets, clear packing tape and dollies. The frenzy subsided by 11 a.m. Indecisive shoppers sat on couches they were considering; others took additional laps to see if they missed anything. By noon it was slim pickings. Prices had been marked down by an additional 25 to 30 percent. And by 1 p.m., only castoffs remained. For many shoppers, this was a chance to score discounted home goods. For A. Piper McCoy, the sale was a lifeline. “We had a house fire in February and lost everything,” said Ms. McCoy, 39, who lives in West Orange, N.J. and came with her fiancé. Ms. McCoy, the vice president of global communications at the independent ticketing platform, DICE, was up at 6 a.m. for this event. “This sale is allowing us to create new memories. I’m coming in trusting this because of Jason’s background,” she said. Ms. McCoy scored an orange acrylic end table, two green chairs in velvet “and knickknacks that we can add throughout the house to bring back some personality and charm,” she said.

The couple had used most of their savings to buy the home, a two-family, for just under $1 million after years of renting nearby. It was far from perfect, but it was “livable,” said Ms. Tribula, 41, who runs August Market , a fashion retailer she owns with Mr. Taylor-Hayford. “And we had seen many, many, many places that were definitely not livable in our journey to finding this house,” she added. The home’s satisfactory condition allowed them to move in right away, and they planned to update it bit by bit, as funds allowed. “We thought we could piecemeal it and do the renovations as we went,” said Mr. Taylor-Hayford, who is a founder of Kin , an advertising and design company, and the outgoing president of D&AD , a nonprofit that runs an international advertising and design awards program. “But the summer we moved in, we tried to do the kitchen and it was a total disaster.” Specifically, they cycled through three different contractors, who eventually either stopped showing up for work or made too many mistakes, and the couple ended up desperate just to finish the project. “By the end, it was so compromised,” said Mr. Taylor-Harford, 42. “It was nothing that we wanted. We decided to just save our money and do a gut renovation once we could afford it.” That moment arrived in 2021. After spending many late nights browsing design websites and binge-watching home-improvement shows like “Grand Designs,” they were excited to move forward. They were also new parents after welcoming their son, Milo, now 5, which made them even more motivated to take full advantage of the space. The couple interviewed a few architects whose projects they had admired online and ended up choosing Office of Architecture after meeting its founder, Aniket Shahane. Rather than trying to minimize the scope of the project, Mr. Taylor-Hayford and Ms. Tribula told Mr. Shahane they were ready for an overhaul. “The first time I saw the place, it looked like a collection of bandages with all these quick fixes that were done over a hundred years,” Mr. Shahane said. Beyond the awkward drywall corners and obsolete pipes, there were structural issues too, he said. Several floor joists had been severed by previous contractors, for instance, and no longer properly supported the floors (Mr. Taylor-Hayford and Ms. Tribula had wondered why their floors felt so springy). After gutting the interior and repairing the damage, Mr. Shahane set about rebuilding for the way the young family wanted to live, connecting the building’s three levels to make a single-family home of nearly 1,700 square feet. Beneath a new circular skylight, a stairwell with a slender handrail is designed to take up as little floor space as possible. Where there was previously a separate apartment on the garden level, there is now a guest suite that doubles as a media room. Upstairs, the parlor level has an open living room, dining area and kitchen. On the top floor, there are two generous bedrooms, two bathrooms and a small home office. The builder on the project, 360 General Contracting, also finished the basement, which previously had a dirt floor, to make space for a laundry room, an exercise area and storage. “Our place is not huge, but Aniket was able to make it feel really open, comfortable and bright,” Mr. Taylor-Hayford said. In terms of style, he and Ms. Tribula are both minimalists, he said, so they wanted their home to embody simplicity without feeling cold. Most of the walls, kitchen cabinets and built-in wardrobes are finished in various shades of off-white. “The paint, for instance, has a nice warmth to it, even though it’s white,” Mr. Taylor-Hayford said, referring to the Benjamin Moore color Chantilly Lace, which they used on the walls. The bathrooms have the most color, thanks to boxes of sage green tile from Heath Ceramics that the couple had purchased years earlier and were determined to use. The tile lines the walls of the primary bathroom, where it contrasts with slabs of creamy travertine. Above the shower, Mr. Shahane designed a pyramidal ceiling rising to an operable skylight, which opens to make the space feel almost as if it’s outdoors. During construction, which took a little more than a year, the family relocated to Buffalo, Ms. Tribula’s hometown. They moved back into their reconfigured townhouse just in time for Thanksgiving in 2023, shortly before welcoming their second child, Remy, now 1. The construction cost was about $1.2 million. For Mr. Taylor-Hayford and Ms. Tribula, the renovation felt like it was just in time. “When you have two kids, you spend a lot of time at home,” Mr. Taylor-Hayford said. “So it’s nice to have a space we love.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/17/multimedia/17re-location-brooklyn-wgjt/17re-location-brooklyn-wgjt-facebookJumbo.jpg
299,"To Afford Manhattan, a Trainer Offered His Services",D.W. Gibson and Marissa Alper,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/17/realestate/ray-harlem-fitness-classes.html,2025-11-17,"Rodrick Covington, a fitness trainer and actor, sought a Manhattan apartment after his Jersey City rent increased. He found Ray Harlem, a new building on 125th Street that he loved, despite it being outside his budget. The building also houses space for the National Black Theater. Leveraging a connection with the theater's executive artistic director, Mr. Covington proposed teaching regular group fitness classes to residents to supplement his income for rent. Building management accepted the idea, viewing it as a community-building initiative. He moved into a two-bedroom unit in June and began teaching weekly Pilates and meditation classes in August, with rent payments made to the National Black Theater.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"When Rodrick Covington applied for his apartment, he knew he couldn’t afford it. So did the building’s management company. But they had a plan. For Mr. Covington, landing the home he wanted in a building he loved was going to require some extra work and creativity. And he was willing, even though he was already exhausted by a long search and a move that wasn’t prompted by choice. “I had a pandemic deal in Jersey City,” he said. “But then the rent went back up, and it wasn’t a deal anymore.” He wanted to move to New York and, assuming Manhattan was out of his price range, he started his search in Brooklyn and Queens. “I was finding places, but they were all in food deserts, at least the ones I could afford,” he said. After seeing 25 apartments, none of which panned out, he decided it couldn’t hurt to give Manhattan a try. A broker mentioned Ray Harlem, a building completed this past summer near one of Harlem’s main commercial corridors on 125th Street. Mr. Covington went to take a look but remembered approaching the building with anxiety and low expectations, worn out by all the viewings that had come before. “It can get a little discouraging,” he said, “but when I walked into the building, my heart rate went down. I felt a creative peace.” The earth tones and mint-condition finishes throughout the building brought him equal parts comfort and dismay. “I was like, ‘OK, this looks like it’s going to be out of my price range,’” he said. He looked at a couple of different units in the building and the red-carpet feeling followed him wherever he went. “It was the first place where they offered bottled water,” he said. Though the building was outside of his budget, Mr. Covington couldn’t shake the feeling of peace it gave him — or his desire to live there. He was smitten by the apartments and shared spaces, but he also deeply appreciated that the development of Ray Harlem included a collaboration with the National Black Theater, a cultural anchor of Harlem. The nonprofit arts organization owns and operates a 25,000 square-feet of space in the building dedicated to the performing arts. The inclusion was particularly meaningful for Mr. Covington, an actor who has appeared in theater productions across the country, as well as television and films. But it’s his work as a personal trainer that got him thinking unconventionally about how he might secure an apartment in the building. $5,290 | Harlem Occupation: Fitness trainer and owner of Core Rhythm Fitness; actor On food deserts: Access to supermarkets with fresh produce was a priority for Mr. Covington. He was surprised at how many new developments he looked at in Brooklyn that did not have quality supermarkets in close range. The stores near Ray Harlem were a big plus for him. “Fresh vegetables and fresh fruit, I have to have,” he said, “and now I can walk out and easily go get them.” On early mornings: Mr. Covington is used to early starts with clients looking for pre-work sessions. Each morning he makes his way up to the building’s roof deck. “I am up at 4:30 a.m. to watch the sunrise,” he said. “It is glorious to see the sun rise on the rooftop over everything, every morning.” In 2013, Mr. Covington founded Core Rhythm Fitness, a personal training business that grew out of his private classes. He has a studio in downtown Manhattan and many of his regular clients live in Harlem. Some had already asked Mr. Covington about opening a studio in their neighborhood — and he felt there was a good chance some Ray Harlem residents might be interested, too. “I was like, ‘OK, I don’t think I can afford this apartment,’” he recalled. “‘But what if we partnered?’” Through his work as an actor, Mr. Covington knew Jonathan McCrory, the executive artistic director of the National Black Theater. When Mr. Covington reached out to see if proposing a partnership between Core Rhythm Fitness and Ray Harlem might be possible, Mr. McCrory put him in contact with the building’s management. “It was like a match made in heaven, because they are genuinely serious about building community,” Mr. Covington said. “And I’m all about community — I have 18 brothers and sisters, and I’m the 18th child.” He pitched the idea of teaching regular group fitness classes in the building. It would be just enough extra income to help him pay the rent. Management took him up on it. “I shared with them my vision,” he said, “how I would build community through wellness, through body, mind and spirit integration.” Mr. Covington moved into the building in June and started teaching weekly classes in August. Students convene in a studio on the fifth floor, and Mr. Covington said more classes will likely be added because of demand. The sessions, which are included in the amenity fees for residents in the building, are a combination of Pilates and meditation practices. Each class, Mr. Covington continued, taps into that creative peace he felt the first time he walked into the building. He still remembers one of the first bank checks required of him to rent the apartment. He was instructed to make it out directly to the National Black Theater. This detail, he said, was greatly satisfying. “I was like, ‘Oh, my God, I’m literally writing a check out to the National Black Theater. Take my money, take it all. This is my community.’” He appreciates that he’s just down the street from the Apollo Theater, too, and that there are so many people from the theater community who live in his neighborhood. Moving to Harlem wasn’t his original goal, but he has fully embraced it. “When I come home,” Mr. Covington said, “it feels like a hug, every time.” He has a two-bedroom apartment with enough room to host friends, which Mr. Covington does often. “I do have a lot of guests, because, you know, I love to entertain and there’s always someone here,” he said. As an actor, Mr. Covington also uses the second bedroom to tape auditions. He put in panels to give warmth to the room’s ambient sound, and he capitalizes on the natural light that pours through the windows. Seeing the sun set through those windows is the best thing about the apartment. “It creates this prism of light” he said. “To have that light beam right into my home, it’s my favorite.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/17/multimedia/17re-renters-covington-bmgk/17re-renters-covington-bmgk-facebookJumbo.jpg

301,New York Lacked an Affordable Housing Portal. So These Teenagers Made One.,Dan Levin,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/14/realestate/affordable-housing-rent-stabilized-website.html,2025-11-17,"High school seniors Beckett Zahedi and Derrick Webster Jr., both 17, launched ""Realer Estate"" in July after identifying New York City's lack of an accessible affordable housing database. Motivated by personal experience, Beckett taught himself to code to create the platform. The website combines public data with real estate listings, allowing users to search for below-market and rent-stabilized apartments and identifying ""undervalued"" listings. It has attracted over 27,000 visitors and received praise from New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams. The project also secured $1,000 from a local agent and up to $25,000 from start-up Audos.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"When Beckett Zahedi was in the fifth grade, he’d accompany his recently divorced father and younger sister on a grueling New York City ritual: the hunt for an affordable apartment. On weekends, they’d trudge through fruitless viewings in Brooklyn, jostling through crowds and sidestepping cockroaches until the elder Zahedi finally found a place to rent. “I wanted to make sure that they felt comfortable in the place, and it’s hard to find something, so he had this experience over and over of being rejected,” Caveh Zahedi said of his son. As he got older, Beckett leaned into his entrepreneurial spirit and tech savvy, designing a website where he could sell toys, and hawking T-shirts online. But he never forgot how trying those apartment hunts had been, both emotionally and financially. So last year, as his economics class at the Brooklyn Friends school studied the national housing crisis, he and a classmate hatched an idea for an online housing platform that could help people find homes they could afford. First, he taught himself to code. “I basically spent the first two months of summer in my room, learning from YouTube and A.I.,” said Beckett, 17. “Those are my teachers.” In July, after countless bleary-eyed hours on bedroom computers, he and Derrick Webster Jr., his classmate, launched Realer Estate , a website that combines public data with real estate listings, allowing users to search for below-market and rent-stabilized apartments — something the grown-ups who run New York City have never managed to do. “This is basically the tool that my family needed,” said Beckett, a lanky high school senior with a mop of wavy hair and perhaps the quintessential marker of modern youthful ambition, a LinkedIn profile . “We’d just see, like, one good apartment a month that we can afford. I thought it might be faster, instead of wasting more years, to just create an algorithm that would do that for me.” The site has already attracted more than 27,000 visitors, along with adoration from local officials, including Adrienne Adams, the New York City Council speaker. During a Council meeting in October, Ms. Adams said she was “so impressed with Beckett and his commitment to helping fellow New Yorkers secure affordable housing.” At first, Beckett and Derrick aimed to create a nationwide platform, manually listing properties as far afield as Idaho and Texas. “It was way too much for us to handle,” Beckett said on a recent evening, sitting beside his mother, Amanda Field, in their Brooklyn apartment, as his sister’s loft bed loomed over the dining table. So they decided to focus on New York. “They’re children of the pandemic,” said Ms. Field, who watched Beckett and his friends develop their digital skills during Covid lockdowns and remote schooling. “They were living their real lives in the digital world.” The curious may wonder why two kids who aren’t old enough to vote would even need to create such a platform — as opposed to, say, New York’s vast bureaucracy. A tenant can officially find out if their unit is rent-stabilized by submitting a request to New York State Homes and Community Renewal. But there is no public database of rent-stabilized apartments in the city, only a government website with PDF lists of buildings containing at least one such unit. And those lists may be inaccurate or outdated. The city’s affordable-housing lottery, NYC Housing Connect , typically receives around 500 applications for each unit listed, according to the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Competition is fierce and waits can take years. “There needs to be a more uniform, streamlined way for people to be able to find affordable apartments,” said Leah Goodridge, a member of the City Planning Commission. “New Yorkers suffer for it.” At a time when the median rent in the city is about $4,000 , finding one of the roughly one million rent-stabilized apartments often comes down to luck, pluck and patience. Amateur sleuths will pore over obituaries for clues; hunters will bribe landlords with “key money” to obtain a coveted lease. Online, the quest has fueled a cottage industry of tips and advice . “If you’re explicitly looking for a rent-stabilized apartment, then you have to be a big-time hustler,” said Matthew Murphy, executive director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. Beckett and Derrick are trying to make the search easier. While Beckett built the platform over the summer, Derrick, also 17, worked on creating an email system for users. Collaboration was “really, really important,” Derrick said. “Sometimes my new update to the project would crash something that he would make, and he would have to call me at midnight, saying, ‘Hey you messed up something.’” Beckett quickly discovered that building the site was “much harder problem-solving than in my math homework.” “It was just failing, getting every single line wrong until it all fell into place,” he said. His algorithm scans active sales and rental listings, cross-referenced with all rent-stabilized building addresses, and calculates affordability by comparing against similar properties based on categories including bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities and price per square foot. Users can search specifically for rent-stabilized units, or for apartments that the site calculates as affordable. Listings determined to be at least 15 percent below market are saved as “undervalued” on the platform, which links to StreetEasy. “It’s not a perfect estimate, but it helps renters get a better sense of how good of a deal an apartment is,” Beckett said. One local agent, Tiger Liu of Compass, was impressed enough to give the teens $1,000 to advertise, and said his first client from the site recently went into contract on an apartment. “It’s very helpful to people because the current resource is just not enough,” he said. Another backer is Audos, an entrepreneurship start-up, which agreed to invest up to $25,000 in the project — with some oversight. “We’re not handing a 16-year-old kid $25,000 and letting him go crazy,” said Andres Zubillaga, an Audos founder. The company has worked with businesses focused on moving and interior decorating, but “in terms of actually helping you with the apartment search, this is the first we’ve seen,” Mr. Zubillaga said. While the website is largely automated, running it still consumes much of Beckett and Derrick’s time. “Right after school, you make sure you get all your homework done, and then it’s your whole entire night,” Derrick said. Indeed, Realer Estate is a work in progress. Some neighborhoods have few listings, and the affordability scores are not for all budgets. The wrinkles are being ironed out between college applications, schoolwork and extracurricular activities. Beckett has been attending community board meetings to beef up on housing issues, and chose to forgo playing on his school basketball team this year. (“I’m not super good,” he admitted.) But like a lot of kids his age, what he is good at is the internet. Plenty of adults have tried to tackle New York’s affordable-housing problem with limited success, so why not give two high school students a chance? After all, Derrick noted, the housing lottery email notification feature that the City Council will require is similar to the alert system he already built for Realer Estate. “What we want to do is see how we can be more involved with the city, learn from them, take our experience and give back,” Derrick said. “There’s a lot more people we can help.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/14/multimedia/14re-TEENAGER-HOUSING-PLATFORM1-gwmj/14re-TEENAGER-HOUSING-PLATFORM1-gwmj-facebookJumbo.jpg

304,Brooklyn Investor Who Stole Homes Faces Years Behind Bars,Rukmini Callimachi,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/realestate/sanford-solny-home-deeds-sentencing.html,2025-11-13,"Brooklyn real estate investor Sanford Solny was sentenced on Wednesday to up to seven years in prison for stealing deeds from vulnerable homeowners. Convicted in June on 17 counts, including grand larceny, Solny built a fortune by convincing homeowners facing foreclosure to sign away properties, then evicted them and collected rent totaling over $500,000. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun nullified the deeds for 11 homes, potentially allowing victims to reclaim them. However, financial restitution for the collected rent was denied. Solny, 68, continued these fraudulent activities even after pleading guilty to similar crimes in Queens in 2018. Victims, many Black or Latino immigrants, faced financial ruin.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Sanford Solny built a fortune by convincing vulnerable homeowners to sign away the deeds to their homes. On Wednesday, the Brooklyn real estate investor was sentenced to up to seven years in prison, closing a long and tangled case that left families in financial ruin. Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun also ordered that the deeds to the 11 homes taken by Mr. Solny be nullified — a ruling that could allow some homeowners to reclaim their houses. But Judge Chun declined to grant financial restitution to the victims, including any portion of the hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent that Mr. Solny collected after evicting homeowners and installing his own tenants. The 68-year-old Solny, a former lawyer from Midwood, Brooklyn, who was disbarred following accusations of fraud, was convicted in June of a total of 17 counts , including criminal possession of stolen property, scheme to defraud and grand larceny in connection with the theft of the 11 properties in Brooklyn. His trial in Brooklyn came on the heels of a similar trial in Queens, where in 2018, he pleaded guilty to stealing several other homes and was later sentenced to five years of probation. At least one of the properties in Brooklyn was stolen after his sentencing in Queens — indicating that he continued to defraud people even after being convicted of the same crime in a different borough. “For more than 13 years, my family and I have endured unimaginable hardship in our fight to reclaim the deed to our homes,” said Clotilde Wendpagnangde Sawadogo, an immigrant from Burkina Faso, in a statement that was read to the court. “What should have been a straightforward matter of property rights became a prolonged and devastating ordeal — one that has inflicted deep emotional, physical and psychological harm on every member of our family.” The victims, nearly all of whom are Black or Latino and many of whom are recent immigrants, said that they were referred to Mr. Solny at their lowest point — behind on mortgage payments, facing foreclosure and desperate for help. He offered what seemed like a lifeline: a so-called short sale, promising to negotiate with banks to accept less than the amount owed, even providing the homeowner a small payment and the relief of having their debt erased. In reality, the deed was transferred to Mr. Solny or one of his companies, while the mortgage — and the damage to the homeowner’s credit — remained in the homeowner’s name. In case after case, prosecutors say Mr. Solny collected rent — more than $500,000 in total — even as the debt and the property taxes went unpaid. “My new home meant everything to me,” wrote Janet Bruce in a statement read before the court on Wednesday, explaining how she immigrated from Guyana in 1999 and bought her three-bedroom home in Flatbush in 2006 after more than half a decade of work as a home health aide. “I bought new kitchen cabinets, got electrical and plumbing work done and purchased all new furniture. My neighbors respected me because my home was the neatest one on the block.” After her husband suffered a stroke and lost his job in 2013, she fell behind on payments and, like others, found herself in Mr. Solny’s office. “Because of Sanford Solny, I lost my home. I lost all my furniture and I lost all the work that I put into my home,” she said, describing the humiliation she felt as her belongings were placed on the curb after she lost her deed in 2014. After Ms. Bruce’s departure, Mr. Solny installed tenants and collected an estimated $270,000 in rent, she said, even as the mortgage and property taxes remained in her name — wrecking her credit and, she said, her chance to rebuild. Heavy security awaited both the supporters of the victims and of Mr. Solny at the Brooklyn courthouse on Wednesday. Before being allowed into the building, visitors passed through metal detectors, and the several dozen supporters of Mr. Solny from his Orthodox Jewish community placed their hats on the belt for security screening. On the second floor, where the courtroom was located, at least 21 court police officers were deployed. A tense standoff ensued because more supporters of Mr. Solny were initially allowed into the hallway than supporters of the victims, and a security official with a bullhorn screamed at the crowd to move back. Mr. Solny, who was jailed in September after a probation hearing in Queens, was brought in by the court’s security staff through a side door wearing a suit and a tie. A woman seated behind him next to his family began sobbing, loud enough that she was ordered more than once to be quiet. James Kousouros, Mr. Solny’s lawyer, disputed the portrayal of his client as a predator. “This is just not a situation in which hapless victims had their deeds stolen from them under their noses — it just isn’t,” said Mr. Kousouros, arguing that many of the homeowners were months behind on their mortgage payments. “The purported victims in this case not only sold their deed on paper, in the open, and received money after draining the properties for every nickel they could after not paying mortgages for years.” When he was allowed to speak, Mr. Solny thanked his family, his friends and the rabbis who had come to support him. He described the anguish of having been jailed in September on the eve of Yom Kippur — a turn of events that he said had been “shocking” to him — and how he was taken to Rikers Island without the requisite materials to pray and without access to kosher food. He never addressed the victims. “He didn’t even say he was sorry,” said Ms. Sawadogo outside the courthouse, where she said that she remained confused about what would happen next: Will she get her house back?",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/12/multimedia/12re-solny-sentencing-01-phjv/12re-solny-sentencing-01-phjv-facebookJumbo.jpg
305,"Here’s Where You Can Spend Less Than $1,000 on Rent",Vince Dixon,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/realestate/1000-rent-cities.html,2025-11-14,"New Zillow research indicates that renting an apartment for under $1,000 monthly in 2025 is common in parts of the South and Midwest. Rent increases have outpaced household income growth since 2001, leading many to spend over 30% of income on housing. While popular East Coast markets have under 2% of listings below $1,000, 13 of the 100 largest U.S. metros offer over a third of units for $1,000 or less. Wichita, Kan., and McAllen, Texas, show over half. Renting a single room for under $1,000 is feasible in 86 metros, and two roommates can rent a median-price single-family home for under $1,000 each in 36 metros.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"You might think that renting an apartment for less than $1,000 per month in 2025 is unrealistic. But new research from Zillow reveals that it’s actually fairly common in parts of the South and Midwest. According to researchers , rent increases are outpacing growth in household income since 2001, leaving more Americans to spend over 30 percent of their income on housing — the generally accepted threshold of affordability . In popular East Coast markets like Boston, Miami and Washington, D.C., fewer than 2 percent of apartment listings rent for less than $1,000. But in 13 of the 100 largest U.S. metro areas, more than a third of available apartment units can be rented for $1,000 a month or less. In Wichita, Kan., and McAllen, Texas, it’s more than half. In Little Rock, Ark., Toledo, Ohio, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Okla., it’s not quite half. Apartment seekers have many more opportunities to snag that elusive $1,000 monthly rent if they live with roommates: Zillow found that the median monthly rent for a single room was less than $1,000 in 86 of the 100 U.S. metros examined. Even renting an entire house becomes more feasible when sharing it. In 36 of the 100 largest metros areas, two roommates could rent a median-price single-family home for less than $1,000 apiece. In Toledo, Wichita, Little Rock, and Dayton, Ohio, the median rent for a single-family home is less than $1,500 a month.

308,"Bars, Restaurants and Buildings Take Karaoke Rooms to the Next Level",Alyson Krueger,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/realestate/karaoke-rooms-expensive-new-york.html,2025-11-11,"High-end karaoke experiences are emerging in bars, restaurants, apartment buildings, and private homes across New York and New Jersey. Beatbox, a West Village bar, opened Nov. 1 with sophisticated sound systems, AI-powered games, and auto-tune features. Restaurants like Coqodaq are incorporating luxury karaoke rooms, such as one designed by David Rockwell with Swarovski crystals. Residential buildings like 1289 Lexington offer expensive, amenity-rich karaoke facilities for tenants, while private homeowners are converting basements into high-tech singing spaces. These ventures aim to create social, technology-driven entertainment hubs, moving people from isolation to shared experiences.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"Beatbox, a dimly-lit karaoke bar in the West Village neighborhood of Manhattan, is outfitted with plush-velvet poofs and decorated with vintage vinyls and large photographs of concerts by artists like Lil Uzi Vert and Chappell Roan. There are three private karaoke suites, one of which can fit 70 people. Performers stand on a stage with a wall made up of LED lights behind them, the lyrics of their selected song displayed on a 65-inch TV, belting into professional-grade microphones. In October, Chelsea Lipscomb-LeSane, 31, a creative producer who lives in Fairfield County, Conn., attended an album release party at the venue, which opened to the public on Nov. 1. She knew right away that it was no dive bar karaoke experience. “It feels like a mix between your coolest friend’s living room and a high-end recording studio,” she said. Beatbox is one of many high-end karaoke spaces opening in New York and New Jersey restaurants, apartment buildings and even private homes. These spaces incorporate sophisticated sound systems and proprietary software — and often are fitted with lounge areas suited for a rock star. The owners of Beatbox, Sara Goodison and Lannie Rosenfield Rydell, who met at Stanford University’s business school, spent six months renovating the space, which used to be a Black Tap burger restaurant (They said they found five milkshake machines during the build out.) Singers can opt to freestyle songs or play one of two games built specifically for Beatbox that use artificial intelligence. One awards points for hitting the right notes — “It is like Guitar Hero,” said Ms. Goodison — while the other scores you based on how well you know the lyrics of the songs. Performers can also use karaoke filters and auto-tune to make their singing higher or add vibrato. “It’s like an Instagram filter for your voice,” said Ms. Rosenfield Rydell. Ms. Goodison wanted to get people off their phones and into social spaces. “We really looked at leveraging that technology, which is keeping people isolated and at home and alone,” she said. “If we are going to create a place that people are motivated to come to and spend time, it has to be this high tech experience.” But Beatbox is not the only karaoke bar in town. When Simon Kim opened Coqodaq, a fried chicken restaurant in New York City, he knew he wanted to have a karaoke room. “I am Korean, and in Korea karaoke is a huge thing,” he said. But understanding that social media had allowed everyone to make content from their couch, he knew he had to create a compelling space. So he tapped David Rockwell, the architect and designer behind the restaurant, to build the “sickest karaoke room,” said Mr. Kim. Mr. Rockwell, who said this was his first time tackling a karaoke room, filled the 450-square-foot space with a large stage, embellished with 1,200 meters of Swarovski crystals. The side walls of the stage are made of a dark cork suited for sound proofing, and there are movable banquettes to fit different party sizes. The room was first plotted out as a 3-D model and took three months to build. Mr. Kim said the cost was on the level of a luxury car. Even residential buildings are getting in on the singing action. At 1289 Lexington, an apartment building that opened two years ago on the Upper East Side, there is a $300,000 karaoke room that has heavy metal doors for sound proofing; 16 speakers; acoustically absorptive materials and a green screen for making music videos. The idea was to create a space where teenagers could get off their phones, said Jill Bernard, the building’s director of sales. “Play rooms are standard, and they are beautiful, but what happens when you are 10 and 12 and want an amenity that connects people and makes them smile,” she said. (Teens are still on their phones in the room. But at least they are making videos together.) In RiverHouse 11, a high rise in Weehawken, N.J., residents have access to a karaoke facility that comes with four Fender Stratocaster guitars, a Yamaha piano keyboard and four Marshall amps. Then there is the private home variety. When they moved into a new house in Warwick, N.Y., in 2023, Darren McNeill, 38, who works in automotive sales and operations, and his wife, Rilke, 43, a physical therapist, turned their basement into a high-tech karaoke room and home theater. “We wanted a place where we could go down and escape from things,” Mr. McNeill said. They use an iPad to cast music videos onto a large-screen TV. It is connected to two speakers, optimally placed for the best acoustics. They sing along to the videos with a karaoke machine they bought on Amazon for a few hundred dollars; it came with a 12-inch woofer, two microphones and party lights. But just like in the commercial spaces, their karaoke room is meant for community. Mr. McNeill said friends now invite themselves over to jam out. “We are either legendary or notorious for it, depending on who you ask,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/11/multimedia/11re-karaoke-rooms-03-fqhg/11re-karaoke-rooms-03-fqhg-facebookJumbo.jpg
309,French Chateau Moves In Next to English Tudors,Tim McKeough,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/11/realestate/birmingham-alabama-designers-french-chateau.html,2025-11-11,"Kevin and Leigh Misso, owners of River Brook design and construction, built a new 6,500-square-foot house in Homewood, Ala. Motivated by the need for a larger home and yard for their three children, they purchased a lot for $450,000 in March 2023 after a tree damaged the previous structure. The exterior of their new two-story residence was designed after a 19th-century French chateau, featuring limestone blocks and an arcade. Inside, it mixes antiques, many acquired in France, with contemporary furnishings to evoke a modern Parisian apartment, including a turret with a striped ceiling. Construction costs for the house were approximately $4 million. The Missos moved in when it was ready in April.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"When Kevin and Leigh Misso began designing their new house in Homewood, Ala., a Birmingham suburb, they weren’t shy about creating exactly the kind of structure they loved most. “We designed the house after a 19th-century French chateau,” said Ms. Misso, 38. “We love traveling in Europe and acquiring antiques,” she said, especially when roaming throughout France. Never mind that the home would be on a street lined with tightly clustered houses built in the 20th century, ranging from homes with neoclassical columns to low-slung bungalows. The area’s architectural hodgepodge seemed to give the couple license to play. “There are English Tudors and some homes with Spanish influence,” Ms. Misso said. “We thought it would be interesting to incorporate some French architecture on our street.” The couple were well positioned to build whatever they wanted. Together, they are the owners of River Brook , a design and construction company that takes the initial sketch to a move-in-ready home. Ms. Misso is the lead designer and Mr. Misso is the director of construction. The Missos previously lived one street over from their current location. But as they had more children — they now have three, aged 3 to 7 — and their youngsters grew, they began to think that it would be nice to have a larger house and a larger yard. “It was about the kids just being able to run and play, and having a yard big enough where all the neighborhood kids could come and play flag football,” said Mr. Misso, 42. In 2023, a massive tree fell on the house behind their former home and caused serious damage, collapsing the roof and compromising a foundation wall. Aware that their octogenarian neighbors had already thought about moving elsewhere, the Missos struck a deal to buy the lot with plans to tear the structure down and replace it. They closed that March for $450,000 and got to work. When designing the new house, Ms. Misso said, “I wanted it to feel like it had been there for 200 years.” The resulting two-story, 6,500-square-foot house is finished with a buff mortar wash and limestone blocks that frame the windows, doorways and outside corners. At the front, one side of the house has an outdoor room within an arcade of arched openings. Ms. Misso wanted a place where she could watch her children play, but an ordinary wood-framed porch wouldn’t fit the character of the house. “Front porches can feel really farmhouse,” she said. Masonry offered the solidity and grandeur she desired. On the other side of the house, she added a turret, which contains a sitting area for the primary suite on the ground floor and a play area for the children above. Inside, the conical ceiling is painted with red and white stripes. “We painted the ceiling of the turret to look like a circus tent,” Ms. Misso said. Indeed, throughout the interiors, she deliberately mixed fine antiques, many of which the couple purchased at Paris flea markets, with contemporary furniture, lighting and art, while adding a few whimsical touches. Although the exterior was inspired by French chateaus, she wanted the interior to feel more like a present-day Parisian apartment, she said, “where you walk in and there’s all this trim, casework and classic architectural detailing, but then you see this juxtaposition with modern art and modern furnishings.” In the foyer, a contemporary chandelier of draped yarn from the Mexican company CoLores Decor hangs above a 19th-century Italian bust on a fluted pedestal. In the living room, an 18th-century tapestry, restored by an artisan in Paris, adorns a traditionally paneled wall above a hefty new rose marble coffee table from Four Hands. In the kitchen, reclaimed 150-year-old wood beams, an antiqued mirror and a crystal chandelier give the appearance of age, but a bright blue free-form wall sculpture by Montana Moore adds a contemporary twist. Even the connected screened porch has a playfully high-contrast look. Equipped with black and white striped curtains, the porch’s wood ceiling and valance are painted in coordinating stripes to look as if the space has been draped completely in fabric. By the time the house was ready for the family to move into in April, construction had cost roughly $4 million. Now, the Missos have a house they love, where the children can play indoors or out, and where the parents continually encounter reminders of the places they’ve visited, and the artists and antiques dealers they’ve met along the way. “I was sitting in the living room the other day just looking at that tapestry, and thinking about all of the rooms that thing has been in and what it has probably seen,” Ms. Misso said. “We look around and love seeing things that have a history and a story behind them,” she added. “We’re just so thankful that we get to call this home.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/10/multimedia/00re-location-birmingham-wzcf/00re-location-birmingham-wzcf-facebookJumbo.jpg
310,A Yacht for Your Yacht,Ronda Kaysen and Scott McIntyre,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/realestate/american-superyacht-buyers.html,2025-11-10,"The Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, ending Nov. 2, displayed 1,300 vessels, including over 200 superyachts. Owners increasingly acquire multiple vessels like shadow yachts for equipment or chase boats. Buyers are younger, richer Americans, driven by a pandemic boom, strong stock market, and tax cuts. Superyacht sales (40 meters+) are up; sales of boats over 80 meters nearly doubled in 2024. Americans own 23% of global superyachts over 40 meters. Notables include British billionaire Andrew Currie and John Staluppi. Superyachts are expensive, depreciating assets with annual maintenance costs around 10% of their value.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Among the rarefied owners of the world’s largest superyachts, one floating villa is not enough. Sometimes you need two: one for the family, and another for the toys. This shadow yacht ferries the jet skis, helicopter and submarine. It also holds the smaller boat that zips you into Monaco in time for lunch at Le Louis XV. Or perhaps you have a chase boat, a speedy, smaller vessel with its own crew that rides alongside the yacht but is zippy enough for shorter day trips. “People have full fleets, and a private jet to get you there,” said Farouk Nefzi, chief marketing officer for Feadship Royal Dutch Shipyards, sitting in a tent at the Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show , the world’s largest in-water boat show, which ended Nov. 2. “These people live intense lives.” Unlike a billionaire’s other indulgences, like a home or private jet, which have practical uses, the yacht “is totally unnecessary,” Mr. Nefzi said. “It’s 100 percent emotion.” On Oct. 29, as Hurricane Melissa bore down on the Caribbean, more than 100,000 people flocked to Fort Lauderdale to look at the 1,300 vessels on display. More than 200 of them were classified as superyachts, meaning they were at least 24 meters long (78.7 feet), or about the length of a tennis court. On the opening day, as rain pelted the docks, crews mopped the decks and leaned over the hulls to wipe the fiberglass dry. A squad of cheerleaders in blue and white uniforms, clutching their pompoms, practiced a routine to Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” amid the crowd. Weaving through the bustling docks, brokers and buyers in khakis and loafers, speaking English, French, Italian and Portuguese, skipped over puddles to survey the inventory during appointment-only viewings. Step aboard a superyacht, and a crew, dressed in matching uniforms, would be waiting with a basket for your shoes and cloth booties for your bare feet. At 85 million euros, or nearly $100 million, the most expensive offering was Hampshire, a 66.25-meter vessel owned by the British billionaire Andrew Currie. It comes equipped with two helipads, an infinity Jacuzzi and a shell door that opens at sea level for lounging. Today’s superyacht buyers are younger and richer than they were a decade ago, and they’re increasingly American, enriched by the pandemic business boom, a roaring stock market and deep tax cuts. Rather than wait for a gilded retirement, they are buying in their prime, looking for a plaything with all the trappings of home. They’re tethered to the world with Starlink internet while they play in St. Barts or Sardinia, or venture to more out-of-reach corners, like the Arctic. Among the coveted features are basketball courts, discos, underwater lounges, gyms, and wellness spas. While yacht sales overall are down amid concerns about tariffs and an uncertain economy, sales of superyachts 40 meters and larger are up from last year, according to SuperYacht Times, which provides industry data. The company also reported that in 2024, sales of boats over 80 meters, about the length of a riverboat cruise ship, almost doubled from 2023 levels, and are on track to hold steady in 2025. Americans own more superyachts over 40 meters than anyone else in the world, accounting for 23 percent of the global fleet, according to SuperYacht Times . Russians, who have vanished from the market since the country’s invasion of Ukraine, are a distant second, at 7 percent. “American buyers are the cork that keeps everything floating,” said Ralph Dazert, head of intelligence for SuperYacht Times. The top 0.1 percent of American households saw their wealth grow by 90 percent, to a collective $23.3 trillion, from the fourth quarter of 2017, when President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to the second quarter of 2025, according to the Federal Reserve . Americans for Tax Fairness , a tax policy advocacy group, found that the number of billionaires tracked by Forbes grew by nearly 40 percent, to 905 people, during the same period. “The wealthy became very wealthy in the U.S. You can attribute that to Trump,” said Jan VanHogerwou, an executive at the Dutch shipyard Amels, while standing in front of the 74-meter Casino Royale, the largest vessel at the Fort Lauderdale show, which his company built. A decade ago, Americans accounted for a sliver of Amels’ superyacht business. Today, they make up 85 percent of it. Among the company’s commissions is a superyacht that can grow its own food so its owner can live onboard autonomously if necessary to escape land during a pandemic or war. “They call them Armageddon buyers,” Mr. VanHogerwou said. He declined to name the buyer of that particular boat — the world of superyacht purchasing is obsessively secretive — but did imply the person was notable. At Benetti, an Italian shipyard, the vessels under production are given numbers, not names, so even the workers do not know who the clients are. But there are clues. A gym in the hull, a barbecue on the deck or plush, oversized furniture are telltale signs that the owner is American. “They are very obsessed with foam upholstery,” said Enrico Bonetti, a Manhattan architect who has designed yacht interiors for Benetti. For Americans, “the look of comfort is very puffy.” The priciest superyachts have traded for over half a billion dollars. By comparison, the most expensive home in the United States, a condo at 220 Central Park South in Manhattan, sold in 2019 for roughly $240 million . But unlike real estate, a yacht is a depreciating asset with enormous overhead. Hampshire has a crew of 17. The Casino Royale has a crew of 18. Annual maintenance costs run at about 10 percent of the boat’s value a year. “It’s expensive to be rich,” said Espen Øino, a naval engineer who has designed nearly 70 yachts, including the Octopus for the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen . John Staluppi, a New Yorker from Brooklyn who made his fortune as the founder of Atlantic Auto Group, and later Millennium Superyachts, owns two superyachts, Casino Royale and Golden Eye, a 54-meter vessel that he hopes to sell for $32.9 million. Mr. Staluppi bought Casino Royale for 120 million euros (about $140.8 million) eight months ago. Sometimes, he and his wife have dinner on it when it’s docked near their home in West Palm Beach, Fla. “A yacht is like a home away from home,” said Mr. Staluppi, 78, sitting at a chess table on an upper deck. But, unlike a house, “if you don’t like the neighbors, when you own a boat, you move.” This home away from home has seven bedrooms, seven bathrooms, three dining areas, and a full spa with a gym, hot tub, a sauna and a steam room. But still, there are “a few things that we don’t have here,” Mr. Staluppi said, like a private bathroom inside his office. So, he’ll probably buy a bigger boat.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/08/multimedia/08re-superyachts-lkwh/08re-superyachts-lkwh-facebookJumbo.jpg
311,Parents Use Decades of Home Equity to Help Their Kids Buy in a Tough Market,Gerald Narciso,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/realestate/home-ownership-housing-market.html,2025-11-18,"Parents are increasingly using decades of home equity to help their adult children purchase homes in tough markets. The Shermans contributed $637,000 toward their daughter's $850,000 San Jose condo, using a legal contract for partial ownership. They also assisted their son. Similarly, Bruce McMullin in Utah helped his son Sam acquire a $610,000 home and aided his six other children with down payments and closing costs. This trend, prevalent in expensive regions like the Bay Area and Utah, addresses a market where first-time homeowners made up only 24% in 2024. Nearly a quarter of first-time buyers in 2023 relied on family gifts or loans for down payments, often seen as an early inheritance.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Kathy Fitzgerald Sherman was only half-joking when she attributed her real estate hot streak to a series of “dumb luck.” In the late 1980s, she and her husband were able to purchase a five-bedroom house in Mountain View, Calif., despite having a lower bid than a foreign investor, she said, simply because their 3-month-old son, Sam, had charmed the seller during the open house. The next stroke of good fortune: Google and the ensuing tech boom moved into the neighborhood several years later. “There was no way to predict that our $500,000 house would end up being a $2 million house,” said her husband, Michael Sherman, 68. “It’s not like we were smart about that. It’s just we were here.” Mr. Sherman, a director at the Toyota Research Institute, and Ms. Sherman, a retired lawyer, have since moved twice, coming out ahead each time. They bought their current home, a brand-new, four-bedroom in Capitola, Calif., for $2 million but below market value as a result of post-lockdown pricing. The estimated value of the house has appreciated by nearly $350,000 in three years, according to Zillow. Right-place-right-time home investments have enabled older adults like the Shermans to accumulate equity over the years and improve their living situations — a financial model that has eluded many millennial and Gen Z aspiring homeowners, particularly those who live in expensive markets like the Bay Area. That equity, however, has allowed older homeowners to help their children join the club. “We have a phenomenon here in San Francisco where the two primary forms of a first-time buyer’s down payment are either tech stock options or the Bank of Mom and Dad , sometimes a bit of both,” said Danielle Lazier, a real estate agent in San Francisco. Ms. Lazier, who did not work with the Shermans, added that the city’s housing shortage has driven up prices and competition, encouraging parents to conduct “a wealth transfer ahead of time and also help their kids get started.” It goes beyond the Bay Area. First-time homeowners in the United States made up only 24 percent of the market in 2024, down eight percentage points from the year before, according to the National Association of Realtors. And a 2023 report from the association said that nearly a quarter of first-time homeowners had used a gift or loan from family or friends to assist with or cover the down payment. Kimi Fry, an agent in Salt Lake City, estimated that the average down payment gift from parents of her clients is, “anywhere from the $10,000 to the $25,000 range.” The Shermans’ daughter, Leslie, 34, and her husband, Conrad Useldinger, 32, explored moving out of the pricey Bay Area to somewhere more affordable, like Oregon. But then her parents intervened, choosing to contribute $637,000 from their savings toward a down payment in 2024 on a two-bedroom, $850,000 condo in San Jose, Calif., for their daughter and son-in-law. The Shermans hope the equity will provide enough financial stability to grow and hit life’s milestones sooner than later. “By the time they’re ready to move up, they’ll be able to take the down payment that we have given them and reinvest that and handle a larger mortgage payment than they’re handling right now,” Ms. Sherman, 69, said. “We’d love to have grandkids.” If not for her parents propelling them forward financially, Leslie and Mr. Useldinger, who are currently going through IVF in hopes for a pregnancy, would “be paying rent until God knows when,” she said. Bruce McMullin, a Salt Lake City resident, is another successful baby boomer who worries that his children are being left behind in a competitive real estate landscape. Utah had the ninth most expensive housing market in the United States last year, according to a report by the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah. The state’s average home price was $547,700, making it difficult for workers — many in their 30s and 40s — to attain first-time homeownership without help from their parents. A former local real estate developer, Mr. McMullin, 76, once built 600 homes on a 225-acre parcel purchased from the Latter-day Saints. But his most recent real estate transactions served as investments of a different kind. In 2022, he sold one of his investment properties, a two-bedroom, $470,000 townhouse in Midvale, Utah, where his son Sam McMullin lived and had partial ownership (around 40 percent). Conducting a 1031 exchange — which allows investors to avoid capital gains tax by swapping one property for another within 90 days — they used the combined equity, along with additional funds provided by Mr. McMullin and his wife, Jean, 75, to upgrade to a five-bedroom, $610,000 house in American Fork, Utah, with Sam’s name solely on the title. Mr. McMullin’s cumulative six-figure financial contribution has enabled Sam, who works in automotive warranties, to afford a $100,000 mortgage with manageable $1,000 monthly payments and have a space for his young family to grow. “I doubt seriously he would ever be able to get into a home,” Mr. McMullin bluntly said of Sam’s homeownership prospects. “With this leg up that I’ve been able to provide for him, he’s got a home. He doesn’t have to work two or three jobs. He can spend time with his wife and his child.” Mr. McMullin, who retired in 2020, also helped each of his other six children get into their first homes, providing between $50,000 to $100,000 toward the down payment and paying the closing costs. Because he and Ms. McMullin have amassed enough wealth to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in their retirement years, they view their financial contributions as less as a gift and more an early inheritance. “And they’ll get more when we pass on,” he said. The Shermans’ financial contribution to Leslie’s condo was set up differently. True to Ms. Sherman’s legal background, the couple drafted up a 20-page legal contract — structured identical to the agreement they made with their son Sam in 2018 when they helped purchase his $864,000 condo in Oakland, Calif. — that split ownership (the Shermans own 75 percent, and Leslie, a couples’ therapist, and Mr. Useldinger, a dance academy director, own the remaining share). The contract protects the parents in the event of divorce, death, job loss or default of payment. The stringent contracts did not prompt pushback from either of their kids, Mr. Sherman joked, because “It didn’t seem to have the emotional content of a prenup.” It helped, too, that their children have a strong financial track record. The split ownership also ensures that the Shermans can reclaim their portion of the equity if needed, although they’ve calculated that their retirement savings and investments can keep them afloat until age 100. Both Sherman siblings have honored the terms of the contract and progressed in their careers, opening the possibility of buying out their parents’ shares one day. But that may not be necessary. “My expectation is they’re going to end up with that money,” Mr. Sherman said. “But it’s not like early inheritance, we didn’t give the money away yet.” With so many millennials and Gen Zers currently needing significant financial assistance to purchase homes, Ms. Fry, the agent, is skeptical that the tradition of wealth transfers can be passed on. “It’s definitely not something that I think the younger generation is going to be able to do at least as of right now,” said Ms. Fry, who worked with the McMullin family. Before living in the Midvale townhouse, Sam McMullin had moved back into his parents’ house in 2012. Not long after, he and his father received cancer diagnoses within three months of each other. Their bond strengthened during that difficult period as they endured chemotherapy and planned for Sam’s future, including a home. When Sam’s cancer resurfaced in 2018, the McMullins subsidized his housing payments on the Midvale residence for over a year. With his cancer in remission, Sam, 36, is newly married to his wife, Javiera, his daughter, Mila, is now 9, and he found stable employment around the time his parents helped him buy the American Fork house. He has not missed a mortgage payment, but Mr. McMullin is ready to step in if his cancer were to return. “I’m prepared to just waive the balance that he owes us, and call it even if worse comes to worse,” Mr. McMullin said. “It’s not something I want to do, I want him to honor the contract.” In March, Mr. McMullin suffered a ruptured appendix that has severely affected his mobility. While he can, Mr. McMullin will continue to set his children up for success. Part of that includes passing down real estate advice. “I’ve convinced them all to treat their home like a sacred cow, and don’t do anything to lose your home,” he said. “Because that’s the one investment in life that a family needs more than anything else.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/15/multimedia/15re-seniors-helpkids-wlhj/15re-seniors-helpkids-wlhj-facebookJumbo.jpg
312,My Landlord Is Trying to Cheat Me on a Lease Renewal,Jill Terreri Ramos,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/15/realestate/my-landlord-is-trying-to-cheat-me-on-a-lease-renewal.html,2025-11-15,"A Brooklyn rent-stabilized tenant received a belated lease renewal offer in late August for a lease that expired in April, which included a rent increase. The landlord subsequently demanded retroactive payment for the increase from April. According to legal experts Steven Ben Gordon and Rosalind Black, and the Met Council on Housing, landlords cannot demand retroactive payment for belated rent-stabilized lease renewals under New York state law. Owners must offer renewals 150-90 days before expiration. If an offer is late, tenants can choose the lease to start either on the original date or 90 days after the late offer. The tenant does not owe arrears; the rent increase would begin in December by choosing the later date. A rent overcharge claim can be filed if the landlord persists.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Q: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment in Brooklyn. In late August, I received a new lease with a slight rent increase from my landlord. My lease had expired in April, but she neglected to get the new one to me until months later. I signed the new lease and dated it with the September date. I just received a note from my landlord telling me that my rent increase began in April and that I owe arrears on the months since. Is this correct? Since I didn’t receive the notice until late August, do I owe the difference for the previous months? A: No, a landlord cannot give a rent-stabilized tenant a belated lease renewal and then demand retroactive payment. Since you didn’t have a signed agreement in place after your lease expired, you never agreed to pay the increased amount. “By no means do you have to pay the difference,” said Steven Ben Gordon, a lawyer in Queens who represents tenants. According to New York state law , owners of rent-stabilized apartments must offer a written lease renewal between 150 and 90 days before a lease expires. Tenants have 60 days to sign and return the new lease, and can choose a term of one or two years. If the tenant does not return the renewal to the landlord within 60 days, the owner may refuse to renew the lease. If a landlord fails to offer a lease at least 90 days before the expiration of the current lease, they forgo the right to raise the rent as soon as the law allows, according to the Met Council on Housing , a nonprofit which works with tenants’ to help ensure their rights. Because your landlord offered a late renewal offer, you can choose to have the lease start either on the date the lease would have begun had the offer been on time, or 90 days after the renewal offer was made, said Rosalind Black, citywide housing director at Legal Services NYC. In your case, choosing the later renewal date means that you won’t owe any rent increase until December. You have an executed lease, and you’re not in danger of losing your apartment, Mr. Gordon said. You don’t have to pay for your landlord’s ineptitude. If she still tries to collect the higher rent for the months before December, you can file a rent overcharge claim with the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/16/realestate/15RE-Ask-illo/15RE-Ask-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg

315,Can Soccer Stadiums Revitalize American Cities?,Danielle McLean and Cody O’Loughlin,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/10/realestate/soccer-specific-stadium-pawtucket.html,2025-11-16,"Soccer-specific stadiums are being built in U.S. cities, aiming for revitalization and revenue. Rhode Island F.C.'s new Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket, funded by $132 million in state payments, exemplifies this, requiring adjacent mixed-use development with housing and retail. However, a New York Times review found these mixed-use components are often delayed or incomplete. Experts like economist Andrew Zimbalist question the promised economic benefits and downtown revitalization, noting that the evidence often doesn't support these claims. While some projects, like the Colorado Switchbacks, show success in development, fully realized mixed-use elements are rare among the dozens of completed or planned stadiums.",,The New York Times,Public/Private Development,"Hordes of fans poured through the entrances and into the merchandise store and concessions markets at the newly built Centreville Bank Stadium in Pawtucket, R.I. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon, and Rhode Island F.C. was set to play a nationally televised match against Hartford Athletic. The sellout crowd was filled with parents, children and hard-core hometown supporters who sported the club’s blue and yellow jerseys and T-shirts. With 10,500 seats, the venue, which opened in May, is one of the most expensive lower-tier soccer stadiums in U.S. history. To build the stadium, Rhode Island officials approved a deal in which the state would pay $132 million over 30 years. But a sticking point was that the project must also include mixed-use development with hundreds of housing units, as well as retail stores, along the adjacent riverfront land. Rhode Island F.C. is one of dozens of professional soccer clubs in the United States that have looked to build lavish soccer-specific stadiums — a wave taking hold in small and midsize cities. The projects aim to capitalize on the growing professional soccer market , and provide new revenues for club owners and excellent game-day experiences for fans. Often located downtown or on prime real estate, they are promoted as catalysts for local business and neighborhood revitalization. But a New York Times review of U.S. professional soccer-specific stadium projects found that the mixed-use development components, particularly ones that include housing, are often delayed or, to date, are incomplete. And those projects, experts say, don’t always bring in the revenue and economic activity that are promised. Officials could justify using public funding to help build a stadium, because they believe it could benefit the community in the way that a public park might, said Andrew Zimbalist , an economics professor and stadium finance expert at Smith College in Massachusetts. “But going around and suggesting that these things revivify local downtowns, or attract new investment to the economy, and grow employment and living standards,” he said, “the evidence is that it doesn’t happen.” New high-priced soccer cathedrals for clubs in Major League Soccer, the top U.S. men’s professional league, have been built or are underway in large cities such as New York , Los Angeles and Miami . But the bulk of soccer-specific stadiums in the country have been built or planned for lower-tiered clubs in smaller cities. At least 50 stadiums have been completed or are in the planning or development process for soccer clubs that compete in various tiers of the United Soccer League; M.L.S. Next Pro, the M.L.S. development league; or in the top-tiered National Women’s Soccer League . Among those stadiums, more than two dozen were completed in 2020 or later or are currently being planned or developed. As the number of stadiums being constructed has gone up, so has the price. For instance, Sacramento Republic F.C. — which, like Rhode Island F.C., plays in the U.S.L. Championship — built its privately funded 11,000-seat stadium for just $3 million in 2014. The club is now in the process of replacing it with a $175 million, 12,000-seat stadium in the city’s Railyards district. Sports ownership groups view mixed-use development as an important tool to generate revenue that would help them chip away at the high price of buying a franchise , and many have turned to commercial assets recently to diversify their revenue streams, according to a 2024 report from the consulting firm Deloitte . Such developments have been constructed around the stadiums of N.F.L. franchises like the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots, and are a central part of the Washington Commanders’ $3.8 billion stadium project . Owning a stadium and the surrounding mixed-use developments affects a club’s valuation, said Pete Giorgio , who leads Deloitte’s global and U.S. sports practice. The exact amount, however, is hard to quantify, he continued, since there are so many different factors: the stadium’s size and age; whether the stadium is in the city center or on the periphery of the metro area; whether the venue can host concerts and other nonsporting events; and whether the group owns the stadium, the land it’s on and the entertainment district around it. “Things get a little bit complicated in terms of how these things are set up,” Mr. Giorgio said. But, he added, “every team that is looking at renovating or rebuilding, or building a stadium or arena right now is absolutely looking to see if they can do a mixed-use development around it.” The Rhode Island ownership group, headed by partners of the real estate development firm Fortuitous Partners , believed building a stadium with state-of-the-art amenities was critical to creating the best possible fan experience, said Dan Kroeber, a club founder. Rhode Island F.C. hopes to rise into the top-tiered ranks on par with M.L.S. after the U.S.L. launches a first-division league, planned for 2027-28, and an eventual promotion and relegation system in which successful lower-tier clubs can climb the ranks and losing teams fall down the ladder. “This has always been about bringing sports to phenomenal, what we call, underserved, markets like Rhode Island,” said Brett M. Johnson , co-founder of Rhode Island F.C. “But it all comes down to the facility.” Jeff Buell is among those vying for a U.S.L. club and a high-priced stadium. His project’s investment group, led by Mr. Buell’s real estate firm, Sequence Development , has proposed a $150 million , 8,000-seat soccer stadium in downtown Albany, N.Y. (The group also includes Rhode Island F.C. investors.) Mr. Buell pitched the stadium as part of a greater $600 million project that would build and renovate several new residential buildings totaling more than 1,000 units, and have more than 100,000 square feet of commercial space on eight acres of underused land. If Mr. Buell could obtain the land, $150 million in public funds and approval from the city, he said, the project would inject new life into a downtown that hasn’t fully recovered since people began to work remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic. “The neighborhoods that are in and around the downtown desperately need some new energy,” Mr. Buell said. “We think that we can be a jumping-off point for that.” But executing mixed-use development around the stadium could prove challenging. At least 12 professional soccer-specific stadium projects that have been completed since 2000 have included mixed-use development with housing as part of the proposal. None have been fully realized, but five have been partially completed. Nineteen other projects with housing baked into their mixed-use development have been proposed or are undergoing construction. Many of those projects are in small or midsize cities such as Grand Rapids, Mich.; Des Moines; and Rogers, Ark. None of the 600,000 square feet designated for housing, retail, bars, restaurants and commercial space as part of the Colorado Rapids’ $183 million stadium project in Commerce City, Colo., for instance, has yet been realized. The stadium opened in 2007. The Rapids’ ownership group is still exploring mixed-use possibilities with city leaders, while evaluating its operations and the land around the stadium, Mike Neary, the group’s executive vice president of business operations and real estate, said in a statement. There’s always an intention for developers and stadium owners to follow through on the mixed-use development portion of stadium projects, said Erin Talkington , managing director of RCLCO, a real estate consulting firm. But the results are mixed when it comes to whether that development actually materializes — or does so at the scope and time frame that city officials expect, she said. Most professional sports team ownership groups don’t have much real estate experience, and are often forced to go back to the drawing board on the mixed-use development aspect of the project when it comes time to actually plan it, Ms. Talkington said. The U.S.L. president, Paul McDonough , argues that clubs have learned how to turn development around their stadiums into a focal point of their city. The Colorado Switchbacks, a U.S.L. Championship club, have completed the first phase of their plans to build apartments and retail around their 8,000-seat stadium , which opened in 2021 in Colorado Springs. The project has quadrupled the revenues of the club, which had struggled financially after debuting in 2015 , Mr. McDonough said. “Now they have a great value,” he said. “They are part of the community.” When Centreville Bank Stadium in Rhode Island is completed, a gravel lot beside it will be replaced by 250 apartment units and roughly 30,000 square feet of retail, including about 10 restaurants and shops, Mr. Kroeber said. A new pedestrian bridge will connect the site to two additional apartment buildings, which will total more than 300 housing units. The stadium itself is on land that was contaminated by a decommissioned manufactured gas plant. Rhode Island Energy and Fortuitous Partners remediated the site to make way for the stadium project, Mr. Kroeber said. The new development “brings life to the area,” said David Peart, Rhode Island F.C.’s president. “It’s not just people coming here for soccer and leaving — it’s folks coming here to live.” Still, building lower-tier soccer stadiums on valuable urban real estate provides few economic benefits, said Mr. Zimbalist, the economics professor. Those stadiums are often used fewer than 50 times throughout the year between soccer games, concerts and high school tournaments — many of which don’t sell out and last only a few hours, he said. “Are you going to want to build a restaurant next to that?” Mr. Zimbalist said. “Are you going to want to build a bar next to that? You’re going to want to build a hotel next to that?” Mr. Zimbalist previously worked as a paid consultant for the city of Worcester, Mass., during its successful bid to build a new minor league baseball stadium and lure the Boston Red Sox’s Class AAA affiliate to the city. He developed a model that tried to estimate the net financial effect of the project over time and engaged in negotiations with the team. In 2023, two years after the stadium opened, Mr. Zimbalist wrote that it was possible that short term the financial outcomes would be worse than his model predicted due to pandemic-related delays. Stadiums can yield similar economic returns to what a city may get from a Target department store, said Peter Boumgarden, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies stadium financing . Mr. Kroeber said the Pawtucket stadium has hosted professional men’s and women’s rugby events and will eventually host a first-division U.S.L. women’s soccer team, concerts and athletic events held by local universities. The vote to approve state funding to help pay for the stadium was narrowly decided in 2022, with Gov. Daniel McKee casting the tiebreaking vote . Michael McNally, who was one of the five members of the state commerce board who voted against the stadium, said he doubted the mixed-use development would ever get built. But if the ownership group does complete it as originally envisioned without any additional state subsidies, Mr. McNally said he would concede that the project was “a great deal.” Mr. Kroeber vowed that the mixed-use development portion would definitely happen, and said that the group is working on designs and getting the needed permits to break ground on the project. But there is a possibility that the club will seek additional public funding to complete it, he said. “This is prime real estate that will become the destination of why people are coming to Pawtucket,” Mr. Kroeber said. The benefits of having Rhode Island F.C. and the stadium in Pawtucket extend beyond economics, Mayor Donald Grebien said. It allows the city to remain a sports and entertainment hub after losing the",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/07/10re-stadium-housing-86702-cover/10re-stadium-housing-86702-cover-facebookJumbo.jpg
316,There’s a Real Estate Agent on My Condo Board. Isn’t That a Bad Idea?,Jill Terreri Ramos,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/08/realestate/condo-boards-conflict-of-interest.html,2025-11-08,"An Upper West Side condominium board faces a conflict of interest regarding a board member who is a real estate broker. This broker leases, sells, and buys apartments in the building, including for himself at below market value, leveraging privileged resident information. Experts confirm that board members have a legal responsibility to prioritize unit owners' interests (fiduciary duty). Using confidential information for private gain to the disadvantage of other unit owners constitutes a breach. While a broker can serve on a board if they recuse themselves from their own transactions, this case suggests impropriety. Recommendations include reminding the broker of duties, removing him from relevant discussions, and potential removal from the board if he refuses to comply or resign.",,The New York Times,Housing Affordability,"Q. I am on the board of directors of an Upper West Side condominium. A member of the board is a residential real estate broker who leases and sells apartments in the building — including apartments he’s bought for himself that were substantially below market. As a board member, he has access to privileged resident information, including financials and personal circumstances, giving him an obvious personal advantage in his business deals. Is having this person on the board a breach of our ethical and legal responsibility? What is our obligation? A: Condominium board members have a legal responsibility to put the interests of the association and all unit owners first. When they use the privileged information they have as board members for their own profit if it’s to the disadvantage of other unit owners, that is a breach of their fiduciary duty. There is a way that a broker can buy an apartment in a condominium while serving on the board without violating that fiduciary duty: If the member is not influencing how the board treats the purchase application for that unit, and does not vote on whether the board will exercise its right of first refusal when the unit goes up for sale, then there is no impropriety, said Leni Morrison Cummins , chair of the condominiums and cooperatives practice at Cozen O’Connor in New York. But your situation sounds more egregious. Board members cannot use information they learn in the course of their work for the condominium to influence a buyer or seller, and they cannot use confidential information for their private gain if it harms the condominium or their fellow owners. If this broker is buying units at artificially low prices and then leasing them, he could be dragging down the value of other units. “At a minimum, this broker should be reminded of his fiduciary duties as a board member, and if he cannot fulfill those duties, he should be given the opportunity to resign,” said Andrew I. Bart , senior counsel with Kagan Lubic Lepper Finkelstein & Gold, LLP. The board should send a letter to this broker citing the relevant parts of its governing documents. “He should be kept away from discussions of his own transactions and should be reminded of his fiduciary duties not to use confidential information for himself when it comes to his own transactions in the building,” Mr. Bart said. “That’s a red line.” If your neighbor can’t agree to those demands, he should resign. If he refuses to resign, he should be removed from the board in a process that’s in line with the condo’s bylaws.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/09/realestate/08re-ASK-illo/08re-ASK-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg
317,The Reign of the Maximalist Couch,Misty White Sidell,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/07/realestate/fringe-couches-maximalism.html,2025-11-07,"Today’s fashionable couches are maximalist designs, featuring plush fabrics, hand-sewn details, and fringe/tassels, embodying luxury. These custom-ordered items, costing $10,000-$60,000, are used by interior designers to help wealthy clients stand out from minimalist trends. With historical roots in the Gilded Age and 1800s France, the style is experiencing a revival, with firms like MBDS installing them in aspirational venues. The younger generation is embracing this trend. Sales of fringe and trims for sofas have grown by 50% in three years, despite high material and labor costs that keep them in the luxury market.",,The New York Times,Culture Led Development,"Today’s most fashionable couches are dressed like Victorian debutantes. The over-the-top designs have plush cushions made of decadent fabrics like French velvet or English botanical prints. They’re sewn by hand, and, most important, stand out for their floor-skimming skirts embellished with fringe and tassels. Once considered a fusty relic, these fringe-embellished couches — often reflecting eccentric color, print and trim combinations — are now seen as the forefront of luxury. They are typically custom orders placed by renowned interior designers, and can cost between $10,000 and $60,000. The look has a history rooted in the Gilded Age. The fact that few stores sell these fringe-accented couches is part of their allure, décor experts say. For many, sofas are a symbol of relaxation and family togetherness, and are chosen for their comfort and utility. For select others, couches have become an opportunity to flex a certain status. This pivot toward more sumptuous sofas, designers say, is an attempt by the wealthy to stand out in a home design market flooded by minimalist sofas from companies like West Elm and Wayfair. To own a fringe sofa is to showcase one’s wealth and access to design expertise. “When you see them, it doesn’t feel like something ordered out of a catalog,” said Emily Eerdmans, the New York-based interior designer and gallerist who has designed many fringe-accented couches for clients in shades of sap green, cerulean and ivory. The concept of embellishing furniture with fringe took off in 1800s France under Napoleon III, and was a favorite design detail of his wife, Empress Eugénie, whose jewels were among the objects stolen from the Louvre in last month’s heist . An appetite for novelty and faster fashion cycles during that time heralded a moment of opulence in both clothing and furniture design, said Freyja Hartzell, an associate professor at the Bard Graduate Center in New York who specializes in the history of modern design, architecture and art. That sentiment eventually made its way across the Atlantic. “It’s the same type of stuff Newport families would have had in their mansions for sure,” Ms. Hartzell said of tassel couches the wealthy had in Newport, R.I., in the Gilded Age. The style’s modern-day revival has been slowly building and can be traced to high-profile design firms like MBDS, which is based in London and New York. It has installed the sofas in aspirational environments like the renovated member’s club Annabel’s in London, which was once a favorite of Princess Diana’s, and the restaurant La Monique in Santa Monica, Calif., where tins of Petrossian caviar are served before a view of the Pacific Ocean. The concept of an ornate couch appears to be an exciting novelty for homeowners under 40. “The younger generation is embracing the past to express their personality through design,” said Heather Dewberry, a founder of the design firm Huff-Dewberry in Atlanta. She added that the couches lend a sense of “cheekiness” to a room due to their use of passementerie, a formal term for artisanal trims. Aaron Aujla, a founder of Green River Project design studio, sells fringe-accented couch designs for about $40,000 to $60,000. Mr. Aujla, who has collaborated with his wife, the fashion designer Emily Adams Bode, on upholstered items, said that pairing them with unexpected materials, like lacquer furniture, can make a room feel more cohesive. There are but a handful of purveyors who sell the kind of passementerie so desired by high-end clients, including bullion fringe, the trim most popular for these couches, which resembles a curtain of small, twisted ropes. Samuel & Sons, a company based in New York City, is a go-to trim maker for design firms like MBDS, Eerdmans and Chroma in San Francisco pricing its fringes often in excess of $100 per yard. In the past three years, sales of fringe and other trims used for sofas have grown by 50 percent, said Michael Cohen, the company’s president. The fact that fringe and other embellishments are so difficult to use may keep them confined to the luxury market for some time. They are sewn on by hand using “giant needles,” said Kim Scodro, a designer based in Chicago, adding that they require the utmost care so the fringe hangs level. Ms. Scodro and other designers said that the material and labor costs required to embellish a sofa with fringe can be more than the price of most people’s entire couches — with about $4,000 in added expenses. But it was one of the trend’s original proponents, Martin Brudnizki, the founder of MBDS, who took the strongest stance on the style. Without trims like fringe, he said, couches some times look like “one big blob.” “I like pieces that have a beginning and an end, they need to be defined by something different,” he said.
